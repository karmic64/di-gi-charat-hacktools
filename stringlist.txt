# this is a list of all pointers to raw strings in the rom, used to build text.txt
# Ptr strings are relocatable, and thus do not have a maximum size
# Abs strings are not relocatable, so there is a maximum size
# if no maximum length is specified, it is heuristically determined by
#   counting the amount of bytes in the string and the nulls after it
# pointer values are relative to the start of the rom
# Double indicates the following strings must be double-byte JIS characters
# NoDouble ends this

Comment "these strings use the following control codes:"
Comment "   %s - this is replaced with a string"
Comment "   %d - this is replaced with a number"
Comment "if a string has a listed maximum length, any characters past this will be deleted"
