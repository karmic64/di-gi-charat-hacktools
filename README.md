# di-gi-charat-hacktools

Data extraction/injection tools that could be used in a hypothetical translation or hack of the GBA game "Di Gi Charat - DigiCommunication".

Refer to the "0GUIDELINES FOR TRANSLATORS.txt" for further information.

There is no ROM here, you will need to find it, place it in the main folder, and call it "DiGi Charat - DigiCommunication (J) [!].gba".

You will also need the [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips) assembler to assemble the assembly hacks.

If you are interested in translating the text or redrawing the Japanese graphics, feel free to contact me.

I haven't done much investigation into the game's sequel (DiGi Communication 2 in 1 Datou! Black Gemagema Dan) yet, but it appears to use practically identical data formats. So if you're into that kind of thing, you could theoretically do some small modifications to hack that one too. I may do that myself if a translation of the first game is ever released.

## To-do

The build tool is not complete yet and the following must still be added:

- Allow importing of bitmap data
- Easy modification of small uncompressed strings in the ROM
