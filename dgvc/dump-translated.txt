Di Gi Charat ~ Nice to meet you!
Even if it looks like this, Di Gi Charat is the princess of the star!
The aim is a big actress! Of course, the store will do its best
I'll do my best with the store manager for the past year ~
NEWFILE 3E1254.txt
I am the guardian of General Kai-Schweitzer, Pyokola!
Are you ready, Black Gemagema?
I have to protect Pyocola from the terrible Di Gi Charat ...
I'm a lieutenant, so I can't take on an assistant
Besides, there are more suitable people, right?
NEWFILE 3E13E0.txt
I'm Ku-Ehrhard
Piyoko has been with me since I was little, and I'm like my sister.
Oh, I forgot to say that I'm Major Black Gemagema!
Hey, Piyoko, I was told to be an assistant ...
No! The assistant is Piyoko!
Wow, Piyoko's guy is angry ... So pass!
NEWFILE 3E157C.txt
Puchiko Nyu
What I am good at is Mekarabimunyu
To tell the truth, in fact, the beam hasn't come out well yet.
Petit this, nice to meet you
NEWFILE 3E166C.txt
Piyoko-Analog III, the leader of the Black Gemagema corps!
Piyoko came from the analog star!
From now on, I won't let you like Di Gi Charat!
All the rest is left to this Piyoko!
NEWFILE 3E17A8.txt
I am Pyocola-sama's faithful servant
Marshal Riku Heisenberg of the Black Gemagema Group!
All for Pyocola!
It is outrageous to act as an assistant aside from Pyocola!
I'm sorry, but I will refuse
NEWFILE 3E1904.txt
My name is La Bi Ann Rose ♪ Don't call me Usa!
The most popular idol clerk around here is me!
I can't beat Di Gi Charat over these two rabbit ears!
The road of Senri is one step away ... Manager, let's do our best!
NEWFILE 3E1A64.txt
What is $ 0?
$ 0 is a different word!
Is it a gem that keeps the store manager's thoughts so far?
Leave and erase!
Really, it's okay to erase all your memories! ??
After all, leave it and erase it! !!
All the memories of the store manager so far are gone ...
The store manager, what a gema!
Gema to make "Resume"
Gema who wants you to tell me your name
Gema wants you to tell me your birthday
Gema who wants you to tell me your blood type
Gema wants you to tell me your favorite food
Gema who wants you to tell me your favorite animal
Gema who wants you to tell me who you are
Is the input a gem?

Speaking of $ 1, $ 2 style $ 3 is delicious!
$ 1 is in the secret flavor and it's excellent!
If you try the store manager once, it's good to recommend this!
The profile of $ 1 looks like $ 2 somehow.
The store manager thinks so too, right?
Di Gi Charat, I don't want to pay $ 1 anymore ~
The manager's boss ♪ The manager's boss ♪
Why don't you go for $ 1 up to $ 2?
Speaking of $ 1, I ate $ 2 on a TV cooking show.
It looked delicious ~ ♪
Trivia!
$ 2 mainly lives in $ 1!
That's why it's so popular with kids!
Nyo! !!
Suddenly I wanted to eat $ 1 asexually!
Di Gi Charat will go to $ 2 because Gema will do $ 1 instead.
Well, I haven't heard of that! ??
Noisy! It's terrible to go against it!
You saw something amazing on TV!
$ 1 and $ 2 were in battle!
It was such an amazing video that the photographer was scared!
Here's a letter from $ 2 who lives in $ 1!
"Hello, I am a big fan of Dejiko-chan. I like Di Gi Charat very much. "
Thank you, $ 2!
"I'm currently spending $ 3 for $ 4 ..."
"I had a dream that the store would burn if I didn't put more Di Gi Charat goods."
Nyo! ?? That's hard! !!
"That's why I think it's a good idea to add Di Gi Charat's goods 100 times more than now."
That's why I'm going to put in 100 times more Di Gi Charat goods!
… Why is the letter written in Di Gi Charat?
Nyo!
… That's the letter from $ 2 who lives in $ 1!
Thank you for your support Di Gi Charat Ganbaru!
Speaking of $ 1, $ 2 seems to be a specialty
Tokusanhin means making a lot
Buy up and sell at the store!
… $ 1 Nostalgic ~ It was hard ~ It was painful ~
That's why I was able to open a store for $ 2!
$ 1 is also a favorite of $ 2!
I remember!
If it's $ 1, it's $ 3 for "$ 2" ~
The venue was separated by hustle play!
Di Gi Charat, you have all the "$ 1" books ~
Maybe you're proud of it?
I'm proud of it, if not by any chance! Do you have any complaints!
For $ 1, $ 2 flowers are precious!
$ 1 born $ 3 said
The "$ 1" goods are sold out right now! Sold out!
$ 1 is delicious in autumn!
Did you know the manager?
Di Gi Charat, you like "$ 1"!
It's funny and I record it on video every time!
If it's "$ 1", you've read Di Gi Charat to the end
The $ 2 and $ 3 love romance made me cry.
"$ 1" is a very popular show hosted by $ 2!
I'm looking forward to it every time!
It's dangerous to drink $ 1 and $ 2!
I feel sick ~
If it's $ 1, you know it
Before this, $ 2 was on board and it was out of control.
It was dangerous, so Di Gi Charat punished him!
Nyo ~~~! You want to drink $ 1 asexually! !!
For someone to use ...
Nya ~~~ ♪
… Muri Nyo! Atka mackerel mirin is stuffy ~
Nyo! ?? $ 1 stopped in front of the shop
Nyo ~~~! Someone will come down?
……………
Why was Majingappa on $ 1?

Musi Kanyo ~~~ Shikato Kanyo ~~
"$ 1" is a play that only the royal family is allowed on Di Gi Charat!
It's too expensive for small citizens ~

One bean knowledge here!
"$ 1" is actually a masterpiece drawn by $ 2!
Impressed by the life of the main character $ 3
Please buy it at our shop!
$ 1 ... I remember mom's home cooking
… Mom
It looks like $ 1 and $ 2 aren't on good terms, but ... they're really on good terms.
I understand
Good for the store mascot ... $ 1
It seems that $ 2 is growing all over the garden of the $ 1 house.
It's a $ 3 curse, it's just a rumor in the neighborhood
Don't you want to eat $ 2 after drinking $ 1?
Ah ... I'm not hungry
Speaking of $ 1, you're from $ 2, right?
He's a good person who carries the expectations of his hometown and works hard at $ 3.
did you know?
It seems that the $ 1 you are drinking is made from $ 2 of clean water.
Manager, only here ... I'm not good at $ 1 ...
There was a past when I was $ 1 and was about to hit $ 2 ~
It seems that a lot of people have come since $ 1 was introduced in "$ 2".
Shouldn't we also advertise our store?
did you know? It seems that $ 2 is booming due to the popularity of "$ 1"
Well it's temporary
Be sure to brush your teeth after eating $ 1!
If you don't, you will get cavities 100%! !!
It seems that $ 1 will not cause cavities for the rest of your life.
Thanks, I don't need a dentist
NEWFILE 3E2980.txt
Hmm ... If you ask $ 1, it's my turn
I'm pretty noisy for $ 1
After all $ 2 production is the best
$ 1! ??
I was thirsty right now ... I
… And the store manager will treat you?
I used to eat $ 1 fruit and broke my stomach!
... I'm not proud of that, Kuu
Everyone should be careful too
Up ... I drank too much $ 1 ...
$ 1 ...? I saw it for $ 2 yesterday
What were you doing?
I'm tired of $ 1 during this time! It's usually too far from the store, a $ 3 house ...
…That's it! Let's buy $ 2 at the store!
If you have $ 2, you can go all at once!
I don't get along with my dog ??for $ 1
Don't talk too much about $ 1
Uh ...! !! By the way, I forgot to see "$ 1"!
It featured a rare $ 3 of $ 2.
Ah ~~~ When I'm off, go to $ 1 and play ~
You're impressed with "$ 1", right?
That's the man's bible!
$ 1 is a really tiring job
But it's also a job that you should do with pride.
Hey, a little customer there!
You're not doing $ 1 in the store!

$ 1, I've eaten Puchiko
Delicious ★
Puchiko, I've seen $ 1

Puchiko, do your best!

Speaking of $ 1, it is famous as a promised place
Sanctuary Nyu of couples with the legendary $ 2
$ 1 and $ 2 don't fit well
When I eat it, I'm hungry
Speaking of $ 1, it was a bargain sale for $ 2
I bought a lot involuntarily
… Next time, I will sell it at our store
$ 1 was raised to $ 2 ...
There is a hypothesis ...
$ 1 is $ 2's farewell family ...
Maybe
Puchiko, I like $ 1 this season the most
Nyu ... I'm hungry
Speaking of $ 1, $ 2 is my favorite
This season, we're gathering a lot for $ 3

Miss $ 1 winning product is a luxury cruising tour
Take $ 2 and go to $ 3
Is that rich?

The $ 1 dusk is romantic and awesome!
Pyocola-sama, where is that kind of thing?
The customer said it!
………customer?
(Customers who came today are $ 2 and $ 3 ... and $ 4)
(That's what I say ...)
By the way, what is romantic? ... can you eat it?
$ 1 is often seen in the neighborhood!
Self-proclaimed "$ 2" fan-like Pyo
A good adult is embarrassed!
As Pyocola says!
It ’s a shame to live too ugly ...
The $ 1 ticket that came to the store just dropped the $ 2 ticket.
Let's all go play next time!
Well, with $ 3 and $ 4 ... the store manager is definitely welcome!
Pyo! ?? Manager, what are you talking about! !! Pyo to deliver to the police box?
If that happens, it's not "evil"!
Piyoko and the others are Black Gemagema! "One evil a day"! !!
$ 1 should be read in "$ 2"
You should read and correct your personality!
Riku!
Hah ... Pyocola
Send the whole volume of "$ 2" to $ 1 by cash payment!
So, let's study life!
I see ... It's a stone, Pyokora-sama
The Black Gemagema troupe is "one evil a day"!
Di Gi Charat said he got on $ 1 the other day!
Piyoko will ride $ 2 faster than $ 1!
I won't lose!
Pyo! ??
Suddenly my stomach hurts ... I couldn't afford the $ 1 I ate earlier?
$ 1 and $ 2 ... Actually, it's a bad match
Everyone should be careful
You see, Piyoko medicine ...
Ku, thank you ♪
"$ 1" goods are very popular at Di Gi Charat's shop!
Piyoko can't lose
Buy a lot of "$ 2" goods and sell them!
I heard it in rumor
It seems that the story of a scout came from "$ 1" to Usada-neechan.
But he seems to have refused
Why? Piyoko doesn't understand Pyo
Thanks to the manager, Piyoko $ 1 has improved.
Next time, try $ 2!
The $ 1 on the back of the shop was fruitful
This is ... can you eat it?
Stop it, Piyoko!
Eating $ 1 fruit will hurt your stomach!
That's right?
... already experimented

Di Gi Charat often takes a "$ 1 bath"! It seems to be good for your health
I want to enter Piyoko too ~
Please leave it to us, Pyocola!
"$ 1 bath" is available as "$ 2 bath"!
It's gorgeous with $ 3 petals scattered around!
Wow! I'm happy! !!

I've been worried about it for a long time, but apparently my reasoning is ...
The $ 1 ancestor is definitely $ 2! !!
If you look at the skeleton and personality of the jaw, there is no doubt!
... that's not true
$ 1 is expensive on the analog star ...
That's how much it is on Earth ...
Hmm…?
Hey store manager, isn't the store smelling $ 1?
When you say that, it smells ... $ 1 smell
I suddenly got hungry ~
What are you guys saying!
It smells so bad! I'm gonna buy a $ 2 deodorant right away!
$ 2 sold for $ 1 is ...
The taste is light!
Is it okay to allow this! ??
What is "evil" than us ... Forgive me!
$ 1 is where $ 2 was found ...
In addition to $ 2, it is said that there are biologically rare creatures ...
The store manager, I'm gonna go again
If it's about $ 1 physical labor, $ 2 is possible
I'm thinking of creating a $ 2 Black Gemagema squad in the future ...
That way, $ 1 and so on in no time!
My $ 1 is my favorite $ 2
When "$ 3" starts, it starts to pay $ 2 to the TV.
Dirty like "$ 1" ...
I recommend the "$ 2 breeding story" I wrote!

The store manager, to say the least, I'll see the beam from my eyes!
Di Gi Charat, people who use vulgar words don't like it!
Nyo? I didn't hear it well, so I'll say it again.

Um, Di Gi Charat, is it a good game?
Nyonyo, what is this business king doing for Jiko-sama, Gema-kun?
Di Gi Charat's grade, to be honest, Gema isn't that good ...

Whatever I say by myself, I felt like I had already taken off my hat for Di Gi Charat's work ~
Aside from the self-praise of Di Gi Charat ...

Di Gi Charat's father and mother, how are you?
Di Gi Charat is very fine! Well, of course!
Dejiko is on this earth far from Di Gi Charat.

With the feeling of Di Gi Charat, the day when Di Gi Charat becomes a big actress is just around the corner.
We should prepare for the party now
Yes, Di Gi Charat is thinking! Well, this is also natural!
The story changes, but it's been a year since the new store manager came.
Since then, the shop has been very prosperous and busy every day.
The cause is due to the popularity of Di Gi Charat!
Nyonyo, I wrote something of course again
It's really hard for popular people ~
I want to do my best next year with this condition.
Oh, it seems that the store manager is calling Di Gi Charat

Hey, Gema will understand you, right?
Well, it's bad for Usada, but it's not that good.
That's right!
No, no, it's not bad. However, it's not that it's okay to jump out so much ...
Well, I can't forgive myself!
Manager! Next year, I'll work hard so that this doesn't happen!
Nyonyo, that's a good idea ~
Di Gi Charat! And it ’s petite!

I wondered if everyone would see cherry blossoms ...
Please think about it if you like!
I heard it, I heard it ...
Di Gi Charat has witnessed something he's trying to do.
That was a consultation about "cherry blossom viewing" Gema
What is "cherry blossom viewing"?
On the earth, when a cherry blossom blooms, it is customary to see it.
Gema to drink, eat and karaoke together
You see!
I'm sure Usada will make Di Gi Charat an outcast
We must be going to eat delicious food by ourselves!

I don't want to know tomorrow
Well then, I'm ready, so let's go!
Oh, I'm back ...
You said you were ready, but what on earth are you preparing?
What happened to the story of going to eat ...
Please come!
Are you alone?
Let me guide you!
Apparently, it seems to be a great success with the family-less method!
I can only borrow this costume for a week ...
Oh, a new customer
Welcome and welcome to Gamers! Are you alone?
NEWFILE 3F1834.txt
Well, finally we are in Golden Week ...
By the way, do you know what Golden Week is?
Of course you know!
Golden Week is a big spring holiday!
By the way, this year's Golden Week is from April 28th today to May 5th next week!
Hey, you know it well!
However, with the help of the shop, it doesn't really matter to Di Gi Charat ~
… Yeah
Good luck! At the time of earning
That's right, Petit, as this says, Gema!
During Golden Week, other shops are selling and gathering a lot of customers!
Gema who thinks about ideas to attract customers so that our store will not lose to other stores!
Yeah! Let's think together and come up with ideas
Eh, I'm sorry for some reason-I'm not convinced-
Gema thinking about it!
Think ...
Hmm ...
Nyo ~~, I can't think of anything ~~!
If you take a break ... no, it's guts ...
Hey, the store manager said something good now!
Guts!
That's right! At times like this, everyone will do their best with guts!
Well, that's right ...
Conclusion Gema!
During Golden Week, everyone will do their best with guts!
Oh!
Gema with a small voice!
Ohhhhh!
Nyonyo! I feel like I can do something!
I just feel like I can do it ...
It's a promise not to say
Gema to open!
The store manager also says that, Gema, Gema who takes a break ...
Agree
Nyonyo ~, I'm hungry because I think too much ~
Hey, should I eat something?
Agree
Di Gi Charat wants to go out to eat! Family restaurant is good!
Eh, family restaurant? It's expensive ~
…………
Oh, Puchiko, what's wrong?
Isn't Puchiko hungry?
Nyu came up with a good idea
Store manager, listen to me
Gonyo Gonyo ...
Mmm ... what on earth did Puchiko come up with ...?
Welcome!
If you have something you want, tell Puchiko!
Pippi Pippi ...
Then it's in stock ...
The person in charge will bring it now
There is a maido! I brought it!
Ordered product Nyu
As soon as I made a uniform like that family restaurant, customers came one after another.
Mystery, why?
What are you saying, Puchiko, you look good
You see, the popularity of the customers is great, and it's a good thing!
Hmmm, costume gema for horses
NEWFILE 3F1EF0.txt
Turn the right one to the left ...
The one on the left to the right ...
Hmm ...
You can organize your luggage
Nya ~
You think so too ...?
Nya ~!
I'm sorry ...
Nyu ...?
Something came out ...
Dude Gema, Puchiko?
Hmmm, is there something I want you to see ...
If you don't mind gema, gema
Nya?
Hmmm, this is the "May Doll" Gema
"Children's Day" used to be a gem like "Tango no Sekku"
On this day, Gema has a habit of decorating armor and samurai dolls and raising carp streamers.
Gema that may decorate if you ask the store manager
So please
I want to understand
Nyu ...
It can't be helped, I give up ...
…………
Nya ...
Wow, I don't know Gema ... Maybe I'm angry ... Gema?
I'm looking forward to it
How ...?
Nyanya ~
Perfectly gema! Yesterday, I had to wait late with the store manager to prepare.
Deae deae, deae deae!
Nya ~!
Put my main force into the finals!
Nya Nyaa ~!
Anyway, Karate is a weapon for the whole body!
Nyanyanya ~!
Good Gema, Gema who seems to be happy for the time being!

Looking at the calendar, it's dental health week from this week.
Manager, what's the cavities ... Mugyu!
Manager, I'll ignore the strange question of Gema now!
Celebrities often say that teeth are life-threatening. Caries is ridiculous!
Of course, I brush my teeth every day, so it's shiny!
Nyo! I don't think I'm going to say that!
Ah, isn't that Di Gi Charat having cavities?
One thing that is inconvenient is to shake the store manager!
I'll answer honestly! The store manager has cavities, right?
... no!
As expected, the store manager!
After all, brushing your teeth is important ... So, let's end this story!
That attitude is suspicious ... Di Gi Charat may have cavities?
Giku! That's not the case, especially!
You don't have to be so crazy
Then the manager, should I make a cake for today's snack?
Puchiko has no cavities!
Nyonyo, the manager's teeth also have cavities.
Even if Di Gi Charat has cavities, it's not strange at all!
I'm cheating, I'm cheating ...
Pattern to see painful eyes later
Manager, I'll get up ...
…………
I'll get up!
Hey, I finally got up! It will take a lot of trouble ...!
Really, I'm an angel with cavities sent from heaven!
Sometimes there are some cavities in the manager's mouth, right?
You can't cheat, God is watching!
No, you don't have to worry about tooth decay if you pull out all your teeth.
Now, let's think about it, pull out all the teeth from now on!
Nyo? Store manager, what's wrong with your complexion?
Oh, wait, store manager! Why are you trying to escape from Di Gi Charat?

Listen carefully, store manager ...
My name is La Bi Ann Rose ... not the goddess of tooth decay
The goddess of tooth decay is currently in the campaign!
What a free and compulsory treatment for cavities!
Now, answer honestly ...
Is the store manager suffering from the right front tooth ...
Or is it the left molar?
Both ...? Hmmm, what an honest person!
As a reward, let's cure both ...
Now, open your mouth ... Ah ~~~~
Oh, store manager, what's wrong with your face that doesn't float?
Well, what does it mean that you don't have cavities anymore?
I went to escape ...
What's going on ...?

Manager, get up!
I finally got up ... I often hear it!
Puchiko is an archangel with cavities sent from heaven.
From now on, no questions asked and heal cavities.
Now, be prepared!
Good morning, store manager
Nyu ...?
Nyonyo? Somehow the store manager has a blue face and runs away ...?
Puchiko, what did you do to the manager?
I'm not doing anything
Hmmm, there are some strange things
NEWFILE 3F31EC.txt
I'm home!
As you can see, I got the bamboo with bamboo leaves.
This is also OK to prepare strips
OK Nyu ...
Sarasara ...
Usada, what are you writing on the strip?
On the Tanabata bamboo grass, write your wishes on a strip of paper and hang it.
You know! Certainly, an uncle called Santa Claus
You're coming to fulfill the wishes written in the strips!
Already ... Manager, say something to Di Gi Charat ...
That's Christmas, that's right ...
Hmmmm ...
Look! After all, this Di Gi Charat is correct!
Ah, yes yes ...
I don't know what happened anymore ...
Everyone makes mistakes, don't worry, don't worry ...
The one who made a mistake is you ...
Ring the bell-Ring the bell-Shanshan and ring the bell-
Come on, Santa Claus!
And I'll make my wish come true soon!
…………
By the way, what did Di Gi Charat write on a strip of paper?
Gema who wrote <Become an actress who crosses the galaxy again> ...
No matter how much Santa, I wonder if that is impossible ...
Puchiko is <Beam from the eyes> Nyu
This year is the time to master ...
Already ... This strange Tanabata is the first time I've been born ...
Gema ...
Oh, store manager, I want you to help decorate the bamboo grass
Di Gi Charat is changing into a yukata, and Gema is not free ...
Ah, shooting star Nyu ...
I'm sure Hikoboshi has stepped off!
Orihime is also a sinful woman ~
Hey, store manager, what did you write on the strip of paper earlier?
Nyonyo, I want to know Di Gi Charat, I want to know!
Similarly ...
Which one ...
Gema that says <May the store prosper>!
Hmmm, I have to do my best again from tomorrow ...
If that's the case, don't bother to ask the stars!
Di Gi Charat will give it to you directly!
Puchiko is at my own pace ...
See you tomorrow!
(All) Oh!
NEWFILE 3F37CC.txt
Store ... san, ...
Wake up ... Sunyu ...
Manager, I'll get up!
Oh, I finally woke up, the manager ...
The manager, even though he came to the sea
Inemuri, doze is what it is!
What's more, leave three such beautiful women and take a nap ...
Almost sin!
Sin is evil ...
And evil needs to be punished!
That's why the store manager is sentenced to "buy in a mountain of sand"
Then, Di Gi Charat will swim for a while ~
Don't worry, I'll give it to you later ~
But stay there for a while
I regret my sins ...
Nyonyo ~, the manager, I'm groaning somewhere while taking a nap ...
... should I wake it up?
Hot particular
NEWFILE 3F3A98.txt
Hey, store manager, will you open a store on the next 15th festival day?
After all, character goods are for fairs!
Di Gi Charat is the opposite!
why? I think it's a good idea ...
It ’s not good! Once you open the store, you won't have time to play at the festival!
If that's the case, the festival will be ruined!
If you disagree, you disagree!
I'm not obsessed with it ...
What about Puchiko?
On the contrary! Puchiko also wants to play at the festival
Hmmm, 1 for and 2 for ...
The manager, Di Gi Charat wants to play at the festival!
No good!
After all, the manager is on the side of Dejiko!
Is that okay ...
Then, let the store manager take responsibility for that ...
On festival days, please give me a guide to Di Gi Charat.
I did it, the store manager's treat on the day!
Nyonyo ~, that ~
Unfortunately, give up
…………
Well, don't be so discouraged ... Good luck with you, right?
No, look closely
Nyonyo! !!
If this happens, I'll sell it and sell it at the festival! !!
Today is the long-awaited festival day!
Let's start the festival!
This apple candy is pretty delicious ~
Well, what should I do next ...
Nyo, "Are you still buying something?"
What are you talking about, store manager!
Di Gi Charat still eats cotton candy, grilled corn and candy apples
I just did goldfish scooping, quoits and yo-yo scooping!
Then, next time, let's shoot!
NEWFILE 3F3F44.txt
Store manager, news, news!
It's said that there will be a festival at a nearby shrine on the 15th!
Di Gi Charat thinks that it's a good idea for everyone to play a lot here!
Sansei!
No objection ...
Of course, Di Gi Charat also agrees, and everyone agrees without opposition!
So, by majority vote, we all decided to go to the festival on the 15th!
Wow, crackling ...
Oh, but one problem ...
What?
Speaking of summer festivals, yukata, yukata!
No matter what, it looks like this ...
Pupupu, especially Usada's clothes, aren't the most summer festival-like clothes!
Muka ...
You're not the same!
Stop the futile fight
Hmm ... I wonder if I have to go in this style after all ...
Nyonyo, let's expect the size of the store manager's vessel here!
I'll buy it! A little stuffy ...
Well, really ...?
But I wonder if it's okay to get something so expensive
What do you mean, Di Gi Charat works for the store every day!
So, this is a thank-you message from the manager Shankara to Di Gi Charat!
It's rude to refrain from doing so!
I wonder ...
Well then, goodness is in a hurry, and I wonder if the store manager's favor will make me happy ...
Don't be crazy, yukata isn't that cheap ...
Nyonyo, I can't help it, so I'm not going to wear a yukata ...
You don't have to hesitate
There is Kejimenyu ...
If Di Gi Charat wants it, that's fine ...
No…
Then how about this?
We also open a shop at the festival!
In this case, you don't have to wear a yukata to look good, right?
Good idea ...
There seems to be no objection ...
So, on the day of the festival, we decided to sell the goods and make a lot of money!
Usada's guy is late!
The festival will start soon!
Even if you don't rush, the festival is held until late ...
The store manager, Gema who got a call because it's a rabbit!
What did you say about Usada?
"Sorry, it took a lot of time to prepare the yukata ... I'm sorry, but can you wait a little longer?"
Gema who said ...
It's this mouth, this mouth ...!
Hi, don't pinch it ...
Plump!
Already, Di Gi Charat will go ahead without waiting! !!
Nyonyo, this is a festival ...
This is the first time I've seen a festival on Earth ...
Everything you see and hear is new ~
Nyonyo, there's something interesting over there ~
Di Gi Charat, Gema who shouldn't go first alone
I'll join you later ...
Oh, the store manager!
I'm sorry, I'm too late ...
I've done something wrong with Di Gi Charat
I have to apologize later ...
The cause was that I couldn't tie the obi well ...
By the way, what about Di Gi Charat?
... Yeah, I went first ...
Then, let's walk together for the time being, the store manager
NEWFILE 3F4774.txt
Hey, what should I do with the festival on the 15th?
Nyonyo ~
Di Gi Charat, I think it's one way to open a store and earn a summer bonus.
I also agree with Di Gi Charat! … How about Puchiko?
I want to scoop up a goldfish ...
That's the trick ... I'm not good at all ...
It's easy to scoop goldfish ~
How do you do it?
When you shoot the beam into the water from your eyes, the goldfish will float!
The rest is completely unlimited ~
Don't imitate a good girl!
Don't worry, good boys can't get a beam out of their eyes, so it's okay ~
Well, that's right ... well, what were you talking about?
It was a story that Puchiko wanted to scoop goldfish.
I'm sorry for derailing ...
Di Gi Charat is busy at the store, so I'd like to ask the store manager to lead Petitko.
To undertake
I'm grateful ...
Then, Di Gi Charat will start preparing for the opening of the store ~
I just said a little, so it's okay ...
By the way, why did Puchiko want to scoop goldfish?
Nothing in particular ...
Speaking of which, I ate fish yesterday ...
What do you mean ...
You shouldn't ask ~
It's sunny today, and it's a perfect day for the festival ...
Nyonyo, it's burning!
Oh, that's right! I had something to give to Puchiko before I went out
Yes this
Yukata Nyu ...
Yes, the yukata I wore when I was about Puchiko!
Don't hesitate to use it
Throbbing ...
The first goldfish scooping ...
…………
Sukuunyu!
Welcome back ~
Welcome back, Puchiko store manager
Did you scoop the goldfish well?
By the way, Di Gi Charat was a great success!
Powerless justice is powerless ...
Oh ... it looks like it was a shame ...
Don't be discouraged by this, and continue to devote yourself!
If you make an effort, one day you will get a good beam from your eyes!
That's not right ...
NEWFILE 3F4D48.txt
Hmm ...
What's wrong with sighing, isn't it?
Starting tomorrow, the second semester will start ... The fun summer vacation will end today ...
Nyonyo, a story that has nothing to do with Di Gi Charat ~
Oh, not really?
Why?
After all, when school starts, the number of customers coming to the store will decrease, right?
At least it can't be the same as summer vacation ...
The number of customers will decrease ... Nyonyo, that's a pinch!
Somehow, I have to think of a hand that will attract the attention of the customers ...
Nyonyo ... Ideas, Ideas ...
Gema, if you have any good ideas, I'll tell you!
Kyu, Gema who is in trouble even if such a thing is suddenly said ...
You just finished the summer vacation, right? It's difficult in terms of time
Summer events are usually done during the summer vacation ...
It's about time you came up with something, Gema?
That's why it's a heavy load for Gema ...
At all, its yellow and round body is just a decoration ...!
Well, it's kind of embarrassing to be praised so much ...
I didn't praise you!
Yes yes ...
It's distracting, so please do it somewhere else ...
See this
Newspaper flyer?
Puchiko has a good idea ...
Well, I'll read ...
"Nankinmachi specialty, Mid-Autumn Festival. This year will be held on September 8th!"
I see, Mid-Autumn Festival ...
What is Mid-Autumn Festival?
Well, it's a summer festival, but it's not Japan but China.
If it's a summer festival, did you do it the other day?
Because it's the lunar calendar, it will shift in a few weeks
Umm ... Is that something like that ...
Anyway, it's a good time next week, let's do it!
By the way, why are these guys doing Chinese festivals?
Well ... it doesn't matter ...
That's it!
I just said that Puchiko is good!
That's it! This kind of thing wins what you do, wins what you do!
Nyonyo, I'm at a loss ...
In such a case, I think it's best to let the store manager decide ...
Sometimes Gema is also good
Manager, do you think it's OK to do the Mid-Autumn Festival?
Don't do the Mid-Autumn Festival
It's decided!
Well then, let's get ready for next week
Nyonyo ... I have to study China by next week ~
It's okay, if you say "Acho" or "Aryo", it's okay ...
A, Acho, and Di Gi Charat!
Good, good ...
I feel like I'm being fooled ...
Di Gi Charat doesn't agree with me ~
So, that idea is crap
I'm selfish ...
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, many customers ...
Mid-Autumn Festival, great success
Acho ~ Welcome, Welcome Al Nyo ~
Al Nyo is on sale for the Mid-Autumn Festival right now!
Now, at the cash register, we are giving away Chinese Manju.
Di Gi Charat seems to be very popular ...
I wonder if my guidance was good after all?
It doesn't matter ... It's a subtle point that I can't say ...
Well, today is the Mid-Autumn Festival ...
I wonder if customers will come ...
Very good!
Customers are already starting to line up on the table!
Usa! Don't relax in such a place, open the shop early ~
Wait a little longer! I haven't changed my clothes yet ...
Hurry up!
Welcome ~ ♪ Welcome today ~!
How about Xiaolongbao and meat bun?
Ugh, please enjoy yourself today ~
Nyonyo ... Usada's guy, it's a pretty good guy ...
You can't lose this!
This one will also compete with a flashy performance!
Come on, let's see! This is China's 4,000-year-old deadly fist "Eyes to Beam" Al Nyo!
So, I didn't know from my eyes that the beam was Chinese martial arts!
What should I do if Gema is deceived ...
Nyonyo, today's Mid-Autumn Festival, I hope customers will come ~
It's okay, I've advertised it perfectly!
Nyonyo, then the store will open ~
Hmmm, it's usually a day off, but there are a lot of customers ...
Rather, I wonder if there are more than usual ...
By the way, I haven't seen Puchiko since morning, but are you on holiday today?
Nyo?
Puchiko is standing in front of the store from the morning, right?
Well, that was Puchiko!
I thought it was a doll because it didn't move at all ...
…………
…………
It ’s very hard to stay still ...
Di Gi Charat!
What?
How much is the price of the doll at the entrance?
eh?
No, there is a customer who wants that ...
That's not for sale!
This story is not good for Puchiko ...
NEWFILE 3F59E8.txt
Is there something you need to do?
Apply for a poster model job at Di Gi Charat! ??
Again, the store manager, nowadays, it's like April Fool's Day, it's a stunning guy ...
It's true! Did you get caught ...
… Really?
... isn't it a lie?
Nyonyo, then I'll take over ~
And what kind of poster is it?
Hmmmm ... I see, it's a promotional poster for Animal Protection Week starting next week ...
It's a perfect project for Di Gi Charat, who is as cute as a pet!
Well then, let's get started ~
The store manager is also bad at all!
If I told this story to Usada, I would have been caught in it ...
… Did you call it?
Nah, nothing!
Hey, hey, hey!
Nyonyo, it's a rabbit, but it's noisy from the morning ...
What the hell is this poster!
Request from Di Gi Charat ...
Let's cherish small life!
Well, this doesn't mean Di Gi Charat's poster debut!
It's a shame that you'll be overtaken by Di Gi Charat!
Nyohohoho, Di Gi Charat wins ...
This kind of thing is a start ...
NEWFILE 3F5DBC.txt
Manager ... I have a little consultation, but is it okay?
Actually, I was scouted in the city a while ago ...
"You are the perfect image! ... Rather, I can't think of anything other than you!" ...
What should I do, it seems to be some kind of promotional poster ...
I wonder if it's okay to accept it ...
You see, because if this suddenly becomes a popular model
You may not be able to help the store with the store manager ...
Hey, what do you think of the store manager?
You should do it! The one who quit ...
Yeah, it's still early ...
I'm a little disappointed, but I'll decline!
Yup…
Take courage and do your best ...
Then I'll report the result next week ...
Kon'nichiwa' ...
Oh, you're here!
... what?
I heard the story from the store manager! I'll show you the poster as soon as possible!
This is ...
I also eat every day-carrots
Nyonyo, this is Kessaku Nyo ~
That's fine ...
... what?
The reward was for a year of carrots ...
One year's worth of carrots ...
I can't help laughing at this!
Please! Take it with you because it's fine!
Who will leave the carrots ...
NEWFILE 3F61CC.txt
Oh, the store manager, what are you doing with so many photos spread out?
Choose a photo ...?
Hmmm, a promotional poster for Animal Protection Week starting next week ...
The store manager also has a wide range of relationships
Well, which one should I choose?
Hmmm, Gema who leaves it to Gema's eyes ...
It's not a bad guy who has been doing this for many years ...
…………
…………
I think it's better to follow the theory here than to get strange ...
… Then, I think this two-shot photo of petite and animals is the best!
Not good enough to do it ...
Isn't it good?
Oh, I'm sorry I'm not useful ...
It's bad to get in the way, so Gema is already going ...
Children and animals ... If these two are together, there is no doubt that your liking will increase!
In addition, it also serves as a promotion for the store, and there is nothing to say!
I'm looking forward to next week when the poster will be completed!
Nyonyo, what the poster is!
Oh, you saw Di Gi Charat too!
Contact and cherish ...
That poster is cute, isn't it?
When I heard the story, it wasn't the poster made by the store manager!
Good sense! The store manager has reviewed it!
So where did that Puchiko go?
It doesn't come out from the back of the store ...
I wonder what happened when the customers who saw the posters came one after another from a while ago.
I'm sure you're shy
A lot of customers are coming to see Puchiko!
But why is it hidden in such a place?
I don't like Puchiko to stand out more than necessary ...
Gema that doesn't have to be so shy ...
Ho, hot, especially ...
NEWFILE 3F66C8.txt
Ah, another week after the fun summer vacation ...
Yeah, it ’s lonely that summer vacation is over, it ’s lonely.
Don't say anything techy! You mean, you didn't go to school, right?
That's right! Dejiko is the princess of Di Gi Charat, so you don't have to go to school ~
Wow, for those who feel like summer vacation every day
Nyohohoho ~ Not so much
I don't praise you, I don't praise you ...
Oh, it's a waste of time to do this! Work, work ...
Work is Sunday today, so the store is closed, right?
…………
Nyo, it was ignored!
It's Namiki to ignore Di Gi Charat! I'll do it!
Noisy! keep quiet! You'll be distracted! !!
Hey, try ignoring people, yelling out loud ...
Is this the rumored rebellious period?
I'm doing my summer vacation homework! It's the last spurt, so don't jam!
Di Gi Charat, bad gema
Nyonyo-Samurai's compassion! I wonder if I'll miss this place ...
…………
Hmmm, is summer vacation homework so crazy ...?
Gema thinks Usada is about to finish her summer vacation homework by the 30th.
Nyonyo, why on the 30th?
30th is Usada's birthday, so Gema
I see, it ’s hard to do it.
Alright, I'm going to take off one thing here because of the rabbit!
Let's give something a birthday present to the rewards we did our best!
Or maybe you can help with your homework!
What kind of wind-blowing gema? Di Gi Charat wants to be kind to others ...
Nyonyo, it's rude to believe in the good intentions of others!
Let's leave that guy alone and let the manager decide which one is better!
Birthday gifts Help with homework
Present ... It sounds really good! I'm sure Usada will be happy too
Well then, store manager, thank you for the rest.
Hey, wait a minute, Di Gi Charat?
What?
Ke, after all, leave it to others?
What do you say! Di Gi Charat just set up a store manager!
Di Gi Charat is sad that he doesn't understand the delicate care of Di Gi Charat.
Well, if the store manager is good, it's a good game ...
Oh ... I'm tired ... I'm gonna take a break ...
Oh, how is the manager doing his homework ...?
Yeah, it seems like it will end as planned if it goes at this pace ...
Well, would you like to help?
Really…? I'm glad I'm saved
Well, then, I don't really understand this place ... Hmm, that's it ...
Nyonyo, I'll do it, I'll do it ~
No, when you do good things, you feel good ~
Di Gi Charat is not doing anything
What are you talking about! Di Gi Charat can't do Usada's homework!
That's why Di Gi Charat wanted to teach but couldn't!
Certainly, that's right ...
But that's not something I'm proud of ...
Wow ... sleepy ...
Wow ... Nyu
Nyonyo, the yawn of Usada has moved to Puchiko.
I'm not sorry
Usada, you have a very sleepy face ... Lack of sleep is a great enemy of beauty, Katsu!
Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't good last night ...
But I've finally finished my summer vacation homework, so I'm back.
Congratulations on that!
Thank you so much ... I don't really want to be so happy
Nyonyo, not so ... Well, the manager, it's time to come!
What?
The store manager will give a present to Usada ~
Usada, happy birthday ~
Congratulations
Happy birthday gema!
Wow ... Thank you everyone ... I'm glad!
If you want to thank me, I'll say it to Di Gi Charat! That's because Di Gi Charat is the one who says it!
But it was the manager Gema who chose the present
I bought the store manager Nyu
It's okay to pour water on your emotions!
Ufufu ... Thank you everyone!

After all, on holidays, it's best to go out like this ~
…………
By the way, Puchiko, what have you been reading since a while ago?
Newspaper flyer
Hmm ...
So, is there any bargain information or good stories?
A pack of eggs costs 100 yen at a nearby supermarket.
Hmm ...
And 5 pieces of tissue paper cost 200 yen.
It ’s just a relaxing story
Isn't there a more exciting topic?
There is an athletic meet
How is it?
Nyu written in the October citizen newsletter
let's see…
《The XXth Citizens' Athletic Meet will be held on October 14th, the day of physical education. Please join us by shaking >>
Not bad, but it lacks another appeal
For example, the winning prize would be a trip to Hawaii for 2 nights and 3 days, or something like that.
<< In addition, the team that won the championship will receive a Hawai trip! 》 Is written
Nyonyo, a good trip
Let's make a decision, apply for an athletic meet, apply!
Participation is accepted until today
Nyonyo, in an emergency!
I'm gonna go and apply now!
You don't have to hurry so much, you can apply by phone
It's too late ...
<< We will hold the XXth Citizens' Athletic Meet from now on-- >>
Nyonyo, I will win today, I will win, I will win, if I win, I will win!
Oh!
Nyu!
Gemmer!
With that, the program went on, and finally the final event, the 100-meter dash time, came!
It was a long and long battle
However, if you win this battle, Di Gi Charat will win.
The crown shines on you
Well, we are the ones who bring the crimson big championship flag home!
So who will be in the 100-meter dash?
How about getting a gema?
Ge, Gema?
I wonder if it's a win to leave such a big role to Ge and Gema?
It's decided! The beam from your eyes accelerates the gema!
If you shoot Gema from directly behind, it's 100 meters in no time!
Nyonyo, let's win the championship!
Well, that's what I want you to do!
It's okay, I'm relieved because I will adjust it properly
Yes yes, that story until then
So who runs?
Worried
(Nyonyo ~, it's hard to say that it was serious ~)
Who will come out?
…………
…………
…………
... Di Gi Charat will do it!
I'll show you Di Gi Charat!
I'm enthusiastic
I'm OK, motivation is important
Puchiko has the same opinion
Well then, Di Gi Charat decided ...
Nyonyo, it started soon, and I was really nervous.
………………
My heart is throbbing
Thank you for your support, store manager!
If the store manager supports me, I think it's okay.
"About the position"
Finally start ...
"Yeah ..."
I'm nervous ...
"Don!"
Let's go
Banzainyo ~!
Banzai!
Banzainyu
No ~ It was a wonderful gema without 3 people in the last 20 meters!
Honestly, I didn't think Di Gi Charat would do that much
Nyonyo, if Di Gi Charat gets serious, it's like this ~
Di Gi Charat
Great Nyu
Nyonyo, praise more!
Hey, show me the prizes, Hawaii travel tickets!
Usada is quick, and the fun is something to keep until the end ...
While saying that, my hand is taking out the bag containing the ticket.
Well, Hawaii travel ticket ~
I've never traveled abroad ...
Oh?
What's wrong?
"Welcome to Hawaionsen"
What is this, not "Hawaii", but "Hawai"!
Nyo ...?
Nyu ...?
Hawaii is a foreign beach, but Haai is a hot spring on the Sea of ??Japan side!
What is that?
What is it?
"Hawai" is "Hawai"!
"Hawai" is "Hawai" Nyu
I hope you don't pour water on your joy ...
Don't be selfish
Well, that's why the Hawai trip will be on the 10th of next month!
"Hawai" Nyo!
"Hawai" Nyu ...
Gusun ... I confirmed it properly ...
NEWFILE 3F7D80.txt
Eh, call me? Who on earth is it from ...
Yes, I just changed the phone ...
Hey, it's not big
What's wrong, urgent business?
Hmmm, I decided to attend an athletic meet on Health and Sports Day
Is it next Monday? It ’s not good, it ’s Health and Sports Day.
Well, what is it that I also come out?
Wait a minute, what does it mean that you have already applied!
Hello, hello! … It has expired
Hey store manager, listen!
If I get stuck, I decided to go to the athletic meet without consulting with me!
It's not good, store manager, it's not good!
Because I have a lot of plans ... Well, if I win, I'll travel to Hawaii! ??
…………
Maybe ...
Hello, Di Gi Charat, I am!
As I said earlier, I'm happy to participate!
The aim is Hawaii ... not the victory!
Cheeks, cheeks, that's it!
Well, I have to get excited!
<< We will hold the XXth Citizens' Athletic Meet from now on-- >>
Aim to win, let's do our best!
Nyo!
Nyu ~
Gemmer!
With that, the program went on, and finally the final event, the 100-meter dash time, came!
It was a long and long battle
But ... if you win this battle, Di Gi Charat will win.
The crown shines on you
Well, we are the ones who bring that big championship flag home!
So who will be in the 100-meter dash?
I'll come out!
I'm the fastest of these!
It ’s more serious than ever ~
I left it to you
Well then, it ’s a rabbit, but it ’s decided to run.
Finally check the shoes ...
Carefully and carefully ...
Alright, preparation is OK, let's go!
"About the position ..."
Start ...
"Yeah ..."
Nyonyo ~, Usada's guy, I'm in a state where I write it seriously and read it seriously ~
"Don!"
Cheeks, cheeks, win, win!
Crackling crackling
Crackling crackling
This time, it was all about the serious running of the serious rabbit ~
No, it ’s a perfect victory game from the beginning to the end!
It wasn't very popular
Ufufu, praise more!
Great!
Great Nyu
Well then, I wonder if everyone can worship the prize trip to Hawaii.
Well, this is the Hawaiian ticket I dreamed of ...
What?
What's wrong?
"Welcome to Hawaionsen" ...?
What is this, not "Hawaii", not "Hawai"!
Nyo ...?
Nyu ...?
I was fooled!
Uh, what is Usada making noise?
I don't know
Gusun ... It's like an idiot ...
Well, the Hawai trip will be on the 10th of next month!
I'm looking forward to it!
I can't wait
My Hawaii ...

Puchiko ...? I wonder if it's okay
If Nyonyo and Puchiko are going to do it, I'll leave Di Gi Charat to Puchiko.
I'm a little worried ...
No, this is the best choice!
Well then, Puchiko is decided ...
Do your best!
Good luck
It's about to start
Store manager, don't worry
Hopefully Puchiko will win
"About the position ..."
Finally start ...
"Yeah ..."
Nyonyo ~
"Don!"
I'm ...
Banzainyu
Banzai!
Banzai!
I lost the game, but congratulations on getting a trip to Hawaii!
No way, the first person will give away the prize ...
The appearance of Petitko who keeps running without giving up even if he gets angry ...
That impressed everyone's hearts ~
If Puchiko takes it seriously, it will be like this
You believed that Puchiko and Di Gi Charat would do it!
I wonder if it's true
What do you mean, Di Gi Charat is like a sister!
Di Gi Charat always trusts Puchiko!
It's about time to check the prizes
I've been waiting!
Hawaii, Hawaii!
I'm sorry ...
"Welcome to Hawai Onsen" Day trip ticket to Hawai
"Hawai"?
… Not “Hawaii” but “Hawai”?
What's wrong with that?
"Hawaii" and "Hawai" ... different
What's wrong with it?
Di Gi Charat is going to Hawaii!
Well, well, it must be "Hawai" ...
Then there is no problem!
The day of the trip is the 10th of next month!
Looking forward to
Well, I thought it was a beach in Hawaii in the everlasting summer, but it was Hawaionsen!
NEWFILE 3F90A8.txt
Halloween is coming soon, do you know what Halloween is?
Of course! Halloween is a funny day when you scare people and get crazy!
Well then, let's meet and decide what to do on Halloween day.
Suddenly too much
Well, I agree with Di Gi Charat
For the time being, this is what I thought about
1. 1. Pumpkin head 2. Dracula 3. Witch 4. Mummy man 5. Franken 6. Wolf Man
How do you have any opinions?
Nyonyo, I think it's good for everyone to do the same thing, but in that case, Gema seems to be a problem ...
Why gema?
Among them, the only one that is round is the pumpkin head.
In other words, that's all Gema can choose!
Especially a mummy man is not good. If you wrap the gema in a bandage ...
Hmmm, it's just volleyball
Oh, that's fine
It looks interesting, so let's give it a try! Puchiko, get ready for bandages!
Already ready
Ge, Gema is good, so let's get back to the Halloween costume!
Nyo ... Is it Harouin?
Oh yeah, by the way, I was talking about that
Somehow, I'm getting tired ...
Di Gi Charat is a witch!
With a mummy or Franken, the cuteness of Di Gi Charat doesn't stand out.
Well, I think witches are good too
Puchiko also becomes a witch!
Then, is it okay to have all the costumes?
I understand. Well, let's break up today!
Hey, wait a minute. After all, what kind of disguise should Gema wear?
Cheers for good work
Farewell
What should Gema do?
Tori-ku, oh, tori-to-mentonyo ~
It ’s not “Torito” but “Torito” ...
Nyonyo, Torikku, Oh, Toritonyo ~
If you don't want to be mischievous, I'll give you some sweets ~
Good work!
Preparation bantan, it's just perfect!
All the sweets in the neighborhood are from Puchiko and the Witch Corps ...
Gema doing her best! Gema is a pumpkin, pumpkin head gema ~!
Big catch Big catch! Now you don't have to worry about snacks for the time being ~
Oh, someone will come from over there ...
Geba!
Gebageba ~!
Pyo Pyo, older sister, I've been waiting for you!
Nyo! ?? Piyoko, what on earth did you come to!
It's decided to steal the sweets collected by your sister!
Now, let's gently pass the sweets collected by your sister over here!
I hate it! If you can get it, try it!
From my eyes, I'm ...
Oops, that's not the case
Nyu! ??
I will get sweets!
Hey, that's me! Give it back!
Hmm, it's a big enemy!
Hmmm, Piyoko was a decoy! ??
Pyo Pyo, the purpose was fulfilled, everyone retires promptly!
Geber!
Then, Di Gi Charat's sweets will be sucked into the UFO of the BG team one after another ...
Di Gi Charat, it's not the case when you're poking!
Hasso, that's right. Somehow, I'll get back the sweets of Di Gi Charat!
Alright, leave it to me here! I'll definitely get it back!
Roughly like this!
I did it, Usada, credit!
No way, all the sweets will be recovered ...
Pyo, Pyocola, unfortunately, the operation seems to have failed ...
Flying in the sky is a foul!
Tohoho, this is a snack for this winter
Hey you guys
What is it? There should be nothing to return!
I'm sorry, so I'll give you some sweets
Really! ??
Hey, Di Gi Charat Puchiko. If it's a little, you can divide it, right?
It's a rabbit, but if that's the case, it can't be helped.
Eat with gratitude
I'm happy! Thank you!
Geba ... It looks like winter will be over!
No, I couldn't collect it ...
Pyo Pyo, then, good luck!
Then, Di Gi Charat's sweets go beyond the sky ...
I'm sorry, because of me
It's not because of Usada
But ...
That's right. It's not because of the rabbit, so you don't have to worry about it at all.
It would be helpful if you could say so
Then, let's take a second look and go get some sweets again!
Yeah, are you going to do it again?
I wonder if I'm dissatisfied with something, Usa! ??
No ...
(I definitely have this in my roots ...)
Did you say something?
Nothing ...
NEWFILE 3F9D38.txt
By the way, today is the long-awaited trip to Hawaii!
Do you guys remember? You got a ticket for this trip to Hawaii at the citizens' athletic meet in October ~
Hmm ... it's not Hawaii, it's Hawai ...
There is a big difference between the beaches of everlasting summer and the hot spring towns of late autumn.
Let's check the last thing left behind ~
Change clothes, toiletries, and a camera ...
Well then, let's start!
It's a good hot water ~
Good hot water
Sometimes hot springs are good too
Hot water is good, but Di Gi Charat is looking forward to dinner ~
Di Gi Charat is hungry
Three beautiful office ladies from the city are staying in a local hot spring town ...
If it's a TV drama, something will happen around tonight.
Usada, you watch too much TV
Nyonyo ~, sad ~, it's too sad to have to go home ~
It can't be helped. From tomorrow, I'll be helping the store again
In the first place, a day trip ticket
The reality is harsh. With memories of hot springs and cooking in my heart, Di Gi Charat will return quietly.
It's not exaggerated ...
Nyonyo!
Suddenly yelling out, what's the matter?
You can't see Gema anywhere!
It's funny, I was there a while ago
Nyu, look over there!
I'm gonna help you!
This is amazing! Gema is being caught by a monkey in the mountains!
I wonder if I was mistaken for food or something ...?
What are you talking about carefree! Anyway, let's help!
Justice will win!
Di Gi Charat, I believed he would help me!
Nyonyo, even with this, Dejiko is the princess of Di Gi Charat, a natural action.
Gema is ... Gema is happy!
Jin ... It's a moving scene
It's not the case when you're alone
eh?
If you don't hurry, you won't be able to catch the return train
Taihen, if you can't get on the train, it's a place like this!
Nyonyo, that's important, hurry up!
Well, wait, don't leave the gema!
Nyonyo, I can't help ...
What are you going to do?
Hmm ...
Hmmm, not!
Nyonyo, maybe I shouldn't have followed this
Oh, why?
The monkeys don't chase
I see ...
I hope you're happy ~
Not good gema ~
Nyonyo, Ge, Gema!
Well, I was back before I knew it ...
Gema desperately escaped while somebody was doing Manzai
So, Di Gi Charat wasn't playing separately!
Hmmm, is it really Gema?
Excuse me during the import. The departure was delayed due to the current Sawagi, hurry up!
There is no choice but to gema. The continuation is Gema who listens slowly on the return train
Nyonyo, so I'm sorry.
NEWFILE 3FA574.txt
Nyonyo ~, it's kind of cold this morning ~
Di Gi Charat, look out ...
I was surprised that this was all white!
First snow Nyu ...
Hey, Di Gi Charat, are you awake?
Usada's voice
What is it for, Usa, so quickly?
What's the drowsy voice from the morning ...
I'm sorry! Di Gi Charat isn't asleep!
I don't care about that, so look outside! It's snowing, it's snowing!
You know, even if you don't tell me, I've just seen it ...
Hakushon!
Would you like to make a snowman before the snow melts? That ’s why I decorate it in front of the store
It's a good idea for a rabbit ...
What is it!
Well then, let's leave for the store ~
Hmmm, how about this?
You should stack more ...
Excuse me…
Perhaps Gema is Gema as it is ...?
It's already crumbled! Stay still!
Ge, Gema ...
NEWFILE 3FA8B8.txt
If you notice, it's already mid-December ...
As expected, it's just December, so time goes by quickly.
It ’s a busy day for Christmas.
It's a bad place to relax, but it's a gem from the store manager ~
Insertion from the store manager? ... Nyonyo ~, I'll open it right away ~
It's a big package, but what is it?
It has something like a red and white coat
This is Santa's clothes!
Santa's clothes can only be taken from one Santa, so it's a very valuable item.
Nyonyo, is that so! ?? Puchiko knows a lot ~
Don't be fooled by strangers ...
I don't know, sin gema ~
Well, this is to dress up as Santa and walk around the city to promote the store.
But there is only one Santa's clothes
So you have to wear one outfit for three people, right?
Hmmm, this is a difficult problem ...
Usada Di Gi Charat, Di Gi Charat Puchiko
And you just have to put Santa's clothes on it!
Where in the world is such a suspicious Santa Claus!
As usual, Usada has a bad taste.
Yes, let's quickly decide who will play the role of Santa with rock-paper-scissors, right?
Let's go goo at first!
I got it
Let's go! Saisho is goo
Rock-paper-scissors, ponyo!
Nyonyo, Di Gi Charat ... not Santa!
Good boys all over the country Have you decided on this year's gifts?
If you haven't done so already, come to Di Gi Charat's shop with your dad and mom!
Di Gi Charat will beg you together!
... I'm going to go there like this ~
Uh, I lost ...
Well then, nice to meet you ~
Nice to meet you
Hmm ... I can't help it
Minasa-n, our shop will hold a Christmas sale from tomorrow!
Please come by all means ~ ♪
(Hah ... It's quite difficult to carry this bag around ...)
(But don't be discouraged here, La Bi Ann Rose ...)
(Because I'm La Bi Ann Rose ...!)
Christmas sale, Christmas sale from tomorrow,
Everyone, come visit us once, so come on!
Puchiko, lost?
Yes, Santa hat
And a Santa bag
Nyunyu ... Heavy Nyu
Are you okay? If that's not possible, I'll take over ...
All right, Puchiko, do your best!
However, it may have been a little unreasonable
Hmm, take a break
......
…………
Nyu, store manager, why are you around this time?
Did you come to pick up Puchiko? Thank you ... I was saved
This year is going to be a good Christmas!
NEWFILE 3FB058.txt
Ring the bell-Ring the bell-Shanshan and ring the bell-
Today is a fun Christmas Eve ~
Now that we're ready for the party, it's just exciting
It's boring just to ring the bell!
Something, sing a song
Well, thinking that way, I prepared a song that everyone can sing!
Usa, that's nice!
What a song?
It's called "PARTY ☆ NIGHT" (party night) ...
How? Is it okay to hear your impressions?
Hmmm, good song
I like it
I decided! Master this song and go to a mini concert tonight!
Nyonyo, today is the day of the memorable first concert of the big actress Di Gi Charat!
Tonight will be a legend
I'm kind of motivated ...
I'm glad you liked it, but suddenly it was a concert ...
First, I don't have much time anymore
Ugh, I got a pain
At this rate, I don't have time to remember the lyrics ~
Get help from the store manager
Nyonyo, Puchiko, that's it! Nice idea!
If the manager, Di Gi Charat is about to forget the lyrics on stage, please support me at that time!
To put it plainly, the store manager is used as a cheat sheet.
Whether the stage succeeds or fails, it all depends on the support of the manager!
The manager, will you do it?
Leave it to me! A little impossible ...
As expected, the store manager!
The store manager is Kagami of the store manager, and the store manager is the store manager of the store manager!
Complicated Nyu
Then, the manager, I'll give you the lyrics card, so please take a look.
Di Gi Charat is practicing singing, no, special training ~
Well then, store manager, Gema will explain how to read the lyrics card from now on
Eh, if you select "View lyrics card" from the options that will appear later,
Gema where "PARTY ☆ NIGHT" (party night) flows once
The store manager sees it and remembers the lyrics because it's usually okay
The store manager's role is to help Di Gi Charat, so there is no need to memorize it in Kanpeki.
By the way, Gema looking at the lyrics card? Or is it enough to go to production?
View the lyrics card Go to production
"PARTY ☆ NIGHT" (Party Night)

Nyonyo ~? What was the next lyrics?
At "Hold Me Baby" ...
Store manager, Gema's turn! Gema to choose the correct lyrics from the following!
Let's dance Sunday Ukiuki Reidi Glitter body
Is that really good?
Gema to think more carefully!
I remembered it!
The next lyrics are "Hold Me Baby, Ukiuki Lady"!
Then I'll sing from the beginning again!

Somehow shy
Everyone, thank you for listening
Thanks to the manager, I was able to sing safely! Thank you, store manager!
Great success, Gema that is also appealing to customers!
It can't be helped, but unfortunately I stopped singing and just played it on BGM.
Hold Me Baby Feeling Holiday ...
Isn't it a little wrong?
"Hold Me Baby, Let's Dance Sunday" is the correct answer

10 days left to leave this year ... Christmas, New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve, busy Gema
By the way, store manager, what's your Christmas schedule?
Hmmm, Gema is planning to have a Christmas party on the 24th of Eve ...
Gema that I think is a good idea ... So what do you do on the 25th?
… A party again? Hmmm, I think it's a little ingenious to hold a Christmas party for two days in a row
How about trying to eat the person who assisted you this year?
I'm sure you'll be happy!
Let's do so! Let's stop
If the store manager is like that, I wouldn't recommend it ...
Nyonyo, Gema and the store manager, what are you talking about in such a place?
By the way, Di Gi Charat has a plan for Christmas day.
Of course, Eve will definitely be a party!
And on the 25th, in front of the tree in the shopping district, romantically white Christmas!
Nyonyo ... When it doesn't snow, shoot a beam from your eyes toward the heavens ~
Apparently, there seems to be a prior contract ... Wait a minute! Such a story, Gema has not heard Gema ~
What do you say, Gema isn't rushing, so it's natural!
It ’s a terrible gema to make gema out of the group ~
Nyonyo, a little contact mistake
I didn't mean to be jammed if there was a gema, so don't worry!
Mumble ... Somehow, Gema was serious
So, manager, Di Gi Charat will be absent on the 25th, so thank you.
Understood gema, gema calling
Are you planning to go out with the store manager for Christmas?

Okay, go nyu
It's my first time to take a walk in the city at night, so I'm looking forward to it.
Nyonyo, yesterday I drank too much, ate too much, sang too much
It's not like Christmas
It's a little early, but it's about time to go out
Then, Gema, the store manager, and Di Gi Charat will go to see the tree, so please answer me.
Welcome Gema ~
Drop Mars!
Come on
Hmm ... I feel like I've forgotten something important ...
Eh, "Will Gema go?"
Hmm, that was Gemmer!
Di Gi Charat, wait a minute! I'm tangled up!
NEWFILE 3FC9D0.txt
Nyu ...
Oh, what's wrong with Puchiko?
Nothing
Puchiko got tired of yesterday's Eve party
Well, I'm sorry that it's Christmas today
Is Usada all right?
I'm an idol aspirant, so I'm tired of having a party, so I can't talk about it.
Yeah, after all, human beings and energy are the best
Di Gi Charat didn't seem to be tired at all, so he went out with the store manager a while ago.
What was that! ??
What's wrong with Gema
Did the store manager go out with Di Gi Charat?
Yeah, that's right ...
I'm sorry! Di Gi Charat can get ahead!
By now, I'm eating at a restaurant in a luxury hotel or looking at a diamond ring at a jewelry store!
Di Gi Charat is thinking about the same thing ...
Oh, what are you talking about now?
Also, just one person is gema ...
Hexon!
Hmmm, it looks like someone has made a rumor about Di Gi Charat
Oh, the store manager. Di Gi Charat would like this shop
As you can see, it ’s already a high-class restaurant.
Nyonyo, the enviable face of Usada seems to come to my eyes.
Nyo, I found a jewelry store in such a place ...
Alright, I'll casually drop in at a jewelry store on my way home ~
NEWFILE 3FCDCC.txt
Today is December 25th, Christmas day ...
Well then, today I will borrow the store manager as planned.
Everyone, thank you for your answering machine!
Welcome ~
Hold Me Baby Let's Dance Sunday
Nyonyo! ??
What's wrong?
I'm singing "Let's dance Sunday", but this year's Eve wasn't Sunday!
I don't care about Puchiko ... I'm taking a nap, so I want you to be quiet
Puchiko, I have a bad relationship ~
Di Gi Charat wanted to go out with the store manager and eat something delicious ...
Unskilled Nyu
Wow, a big tree ...
If there is such a big tree in the store, customers may be happy ...
Oh, I forgot about the store today, right?
Walk a little further around the city and eat!
NEWFILE 3FD0C4.txt
I'm going
Welcome Gema
Nyonyo, Petit and the manager, are you going out now?
That was the promise
Gan, it's terrible to go out to eat delicious food with the manager at Di Gi Charat!
Di Gi Charat Petit This friendship was so thin!
No matter what I say
Tohoho ... Restaurant ...
How many sleeps do you have for New Year?
Give an octopus to the squirrel, attach a feather, and get a new year's present
Then, get a new year's gift, get a new year's gift, get a new year's gift, get a new year's gift ~
It's annoying, so stop ...
Nyonyo, store manager, why don't you come back soon?
If Di Gi Charat was Puchiko, it was Di Gi Charat who was eating delicious food at the restaurant by now.
What are you talking about ...
Beautiful tree
I didn't know that it glows in the middle of the night
Look at the tree a little more, is it okay?
… Hakushu!
It ’s okay, it ’s not cold.
Maybe Di Gi Charat ... No, nothing
NEWFILE 3FD40C.txt
Happy new year everyone ... Nyo!
I look forward to working with you again this year!
Please!
By the way, it's been almost a year since the store manager came to the store.

NEWFILE 3FD598.txt
Hey, this week was Petit's birthday, right?
The 21st of tomorrow is so gema
That's right, you know it well
I'm thinking of giving Puchiko a birthday present, what should I do?
Nyonyo, that's a big problem ...
For the time being, what I can say now is ...
What can i say?
The 8th of next month will be the birthday of Dejiko.
Yes?
Therefore, from now on, it is recommended that you keep your money firmly ...
…………
Otherwise, you won't be able to give Di Gi Charat a birthday present!
Hey, the store manager is also thinking about what to do with Petit's birthday celebration?
Ignore it!
Natural reaction gema ...
Think together Refuse
Then, the store manager decided to participate ...
Well, as a result of the discussion, the store manager will buy the presents ...
By the way, the store manager is really good!
I'll ask you again next month in this condition ~
Yes, I and Di Gi Charat have cakes and venues
In this case, you need at least 5 tiers of cake!
You can't eat candles, so you don't have to
Oh noisy!
Di Gi Charat and Puchiko are like your sister, right? Please take it seriously for a moment!
Nyonyo, there is no reason for Usada to say such a thing!
After all, Di Gi Charat has a long relationship with Petit!
You can't just choose your favorite cake!
That's how much I can choose!
Then, I'm going to buy it now
Yeah, let's go buy
Welcome Gema ~ Apparently the cake is okay Gema
The shop is busy, it can't be helped ...
Nyonyo, the clouds are getting worse ...
There is no choice but to celebrate Petit's birthday without the manager, only with Di Gi Charat ...
A little disappointing ...
Puchiko Today is a birthday party for Puchiko ~
Happy Basude, Tsu-Nyo!
Happy Birthday, To You!
Happy Birthday, Deer, Puchiko Gema ~!
Happy Basude, Tsu-Nyo!
Happy birthday, Puchiko!
Now, the store manager will give you a birthday present!
Pekori ...
Everyone is happy to celebrate Petit's birthday
Especially thank you store manager for giving me a present
On my next birthday, I want a present because it's Di Gi Charat.
I mean, it's not too late now, so give me a present
Nyonyo ~, Ryuishi is Puchiko ... There's nothing left to teach Di Gi Charat anymore ...

Gonyo Gonyo, Gonyo Gonyo ...
OK?
OK Nyu!
See you again, I bought a bean-maki set.
Very good! ... Then, let's decide the demon with rock-paper-scissors ~
Wow, wait, my heart is still ready ...
Ikunyu ...
I'm sorry ...
Good!
Par, Nyu ...
Par, Nyo!
eh?
Di Gi Charat Par, Puchiko Par, and Usada Goo ...
So, the demon is decided to be Usada ~
What's up now! It's a fake!
What are you talking about, La Bi Ann Rose? The game was really fair!
Puchiko is a child, so I don't know how difficult it is ...
Di Gi Charat is a puchiko ...
I can't forgive you for getting caught in such a simple hand!
Well, the demon is outside!
What are you going to do!
No questions asked, eh!
Well, I did it well! Welcome back, that's it!
Pori Pori ... Puchiko only has to eat beans for the number of years ~
Usa, you're a demon, you're a demon!
Hmmm, are you still going to say that?
The demon is out! The demon is out!
The demon is out! The demon is out!
Hey ... I'm gonna do this for today, I'm tired!
Hmm ... well ... that's about it.
I don't care about both of them, but the cleaning is very difficult ...

Hello, La Bi Ann Rose ...
What, screaming out with such a cat ... What are you planning?
La Bi Ann Rose, do you know what day February 8th is?
February 8th?
Well ...
"Ta" ..., "N" ...
Um ... um ...
"Jo" ... "U" ... "Bi" ...
Oh, by the way, February 8th was the day of the needle memorial service.
The needles are taken care of when making costumes, so I have to make a memorial service properly.
Nyo ~, Di Gi Charat's hint is totally ignored!
Plump, don't ask Usada anymore!
If you're a store manager, you know what day is February 8th?
I don't know Di Gi Charat's birthday
The manager is amazing!
The store manager seems to have a good idea of ??Dejiko's birthday!
Maybe the store manager is the one who is most happy with Di Gi Charat.
Even that may be the outlook!
What will the store manager give as a gift for Di Gi Charat's birthday?
Di Gi Charat's birthday is February 8th ...!
What do you mean if you don't understand!
Manager, Di Gi Charat, what's the point of not knowing when this birthday is!
Already good! Di Gi Charat doesn't need a birthday present!
I don't need it, but if you give it to me, I'll get it!
I don't know if I'm there or not ...
Good morning, store manager!
Well, store manager, birthday present!
Wow, thank you to the manager!
I'll never forget that the manager gave me a present today!
Nyonyo, don't forget the manager for the rest of your life
Remember, especially-February 8th is the day to give a birthday present to Di Gi Charat-February 8th is a birthday presentation to Di Gi Charat
The day to give a birthday gift to Di Gi Charat ~ February 8th is the day to give a birthday present to Di Gi Charat ~ February 8th is a birthday presentation to Di Gi Charat
Nyonyo, this will give you peace of mind next year

The store manager, a gamer who wants to be an emergency! !!
Today, no customers are coming in from the morning!
What's more, Di Gi Charat, no, not only that, but also Puchiko and Usada can't be seen!
This is the first time for me to do this ...
What should I do, Gemmer! !!
I'm home
I'm back now!
Manager, I'm home!
... Hey, Gema, what are you doing?
What's not Gema! Since the morning, there are no customers, there are no big boys, and Gema is already Gema Gema Gema!
Hoi
... what is this?
No, it's not Valentine's Day!
Puchiko Karamonyu
Oh, thank you Gema ...
Finally from me ...
Happy gema ...
Nyonyo, even though it's in-law, it's because it's Di Gi Charat, Petit, and Usa!
Gema is happy to get a total of 3 chocolates.
by the way…
What?
What is Valentine's Day?
Sly ...
But I was happy without knowing it ...?
I see, Valentine is such a day Gema ...
For girls and boys in the world, this day is the biggest event of the year!
In a sense, it's a day that surpasses Christmas, Bon Festival and New Year ...
On this day, adults and children will be in the same mood from the morning, so it won't be a business at all ...
Of course, we too ...
That's why I took a day off from the morning and handed out chocolates as I wanted.
Hmmm, Gema who learned
Ah, I got tired because I gave out a lot of chocolate today
It's the same on the right ... Well, it's early today, but I'm sorry for this.
Go home
…………
Hmmm, Gema who has just returned home ...
Oh, by the way, I feel like Di Gi Charat didn't give the chocolate to the store manager ...
Store manager, Gema who will not be disappointed
Life is a long gema From now on, there are still more chances ... eh, gema you don't care about?
This is a rude gema
Nyonyo, this is the store manager!
It's a coincidence that I meet in such a place
Well, by chance, how about something like this?
Valentine's chocolate, please!
What did you do, did you not accept it?
I'm glad I just met the store manager ~
After all, a celebrity like Di Gi Charat can't give chocolate to that stranger!
Well then, Di Gi Charat will excuse me
Oh, the manager, you should eat chocolate slowly and without hassle.
Oh, the store manager ...
I wonder if it's a little time ...?
Hello, chocolate!
I'm always indebted to you, so it's specially made ... handmade!
Eh ... are you happy with Giri Choco?
Hmm ...
Well, this time I'll do that ...
Oh, if it's nothing, it's nothing!

Why are you so moody?

So what about Ku and Pyocola?
He said, "Every day, every day, I'm just working and it's not interesting at all!"
Even if I was told that, it's only been a week ...
That's why he said, "I want to go out somewhere!"
Hmmm ... I'm in trouble with Pyocola ...
However, it is our role to help and watch over Marshal Riku, Pyokora ...
Store manager, I'm sorry, but could you please fulfill Pyocola's wishes ...?
I like picnics in spring!
(Maybe he just wants to go ...)
Don't forgive me!
Well, let's go on a picnic!
It's also convenient for the store manager, you should give up here
It can't be helped, let's think about other measures ...
Alright, good is in a hurry!
Hey, Piyoko!
In such a case, the reaction is quick ...
Then the store manager, the preparation, I asked
Hmm ... I don't like the preparation? What do you say, store manager!
We have just arrived on Earth! You can't prepare for a picnic! ??

Well then, Piyoko has a rest ...
Hmm, store manager, for something?
Piyoko is a leader, so I thought it was better not to hang around too much ...
Or is it better to devise another way so that more customers will come?
You don't have to devise one more
Okay, think about it by tomorrow!
The details are the work of the members
The leader's duty is to warmly watch over the work of his subordinates.
Well then, I'll be enthusiastic from tomorrow!
Wow, what! ?? There are a lot of customers coming today
Even though the store has just opened, there are so many customers ...
What on earth did you do, Mr. Pyocola?
Pyo Pyo Pyo, simple things Pyo!
For a week from today, I advertised a super special ultra super special sale!
It looks like something is going on ... I want to go too!
As expected, the customers came like a mountain
After all, people are vulnerable to the words "super" and "special".
Oh, Pyocola-sama is wonderful!
So what do you serve?
What ...
I didn't think about it
Ah, the number of customers is decreasing as the tide goes down ...
In the end, it's back to the same level as usual ...
Pyo Pyo ... Maybe this is a failure?
Yeah, all the members of the Black Gemagema! Hold on to the customers!
I also advertise the store!
Geber!
Piyoko, don't be discouraged ... how pretty it is!
Everyone…
After all, when the leader is unreliable, the subordinates must be solid!
Gan ... That word is so much for Piyoko now!
Oh, Pyocola-sama, where are you going!
Kuu, the lines I mentioned earlier are not so many!
Pyocola-sama was hurt and ran away somewhere!

That's all for the story ... Manager, thank you ...
The busy Golden Week is about to end ...
However, I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't go anywhere ...
Pyo?
Manager, what is that?
This is an amusement park ticket!
Let's go together! Piyo and two people
… Is it okay for everyone to go next Sunday? Manager Futoppara Pyo!
…"with everyone"?
Wasn't there only two tickets?
What are you talking about? There is even enough for you guys!
Yay! Let's go with Piyoko!
Well, let's enjoy Golden Week together!
Manager, I was able to borrow one ...
… But there are only two
Piyoko and the manager's part?
... I'm sorry, but I can't let Piyoko play alone with everyone working.
Soyuwakede, so I'll just give you my feelings
Pyocola ...
Natural judgment as a chief
Shu, Chief, Geba who will follow you for the rest of your life
What are you guys doing! I'll leave it if I'm leaning!
It seems so! Leave it!
Apyokora-sama's lunch box!
Then the store manager, I'm going!
Fast! It's fast!
Piyoko liked this vehicle!
I decided!
I'm riding this all the time today!
I'm already crazy!
Well, Sansei ...
If Pyo and Pyocola say so ...
Wow!
It's fun!
NEWFILE 40140C.txt
Every year from June 4th to 10th is "Dental Hygiene Week" ...
Everyone, let's take good care of our teeth ...
So I will propose it!
Let's sell a lot of toothpaste goods this week!
Toothbrush in a cup, toothpaste, denture cleaning agent ...
Let's have all kinds of toothpaste goods in the store!
Kai is on fire ...
When it comes to teeth, the lieutenant general changes people ...
It's the same as Riku in front of animals!
Kai, do your best! Maybe it's overkill ...
That's right ... Unfortunately, I follow the store manager's instructions ...
The manager said well! You don't have to look so sorry!
Compassion is forbidden! This saved everyone!
Dental treatment is always painful ...
… Ah, I remembered when Kai pulled out my cavities.
Anyway, I'm glad I didn't feel it hurt!
OK! This Kai will do his best to improve the dental health of the people of the earth ...
It started ...
Well, this week's patience ...
Yeah ... I might have cavities now ...
Then, is it all right, store manager?
Well, let's do a dental examination from now on ...
By the way, the store manager is the last one ...
We're done ...
All that remains is the store manager, you ...
Yes, store manager, please open your mouth wide ...
Hmm ... this needs to be scraped ...
Manager, please raise your hand if it hurts ...
Everyone, close your ears!
Preparation is OK!
It's blocked!
(Everyone got used to it ...)
(Oh, the store manager is raising his hand ...)
…………………………………………
(I'm sure you're gonna do it)
(I can't hear it because I'm blocking my ears ...)
………………………………
(Mmm, it looks like it's over)
(A terrifying sight no matter how many times I see it ...)
Manager, my complexion is still pale
It seems that the cavities were worse than I expected.
So what about next year's Dental Hygiene Week?
Piyoko brushes her teeth every day!
The store manager also polishes with Piyo!
NEWFILE 401A28.txt
Summer vacation from today ...
Hmmm, Piyoko wants to do something summery ...
That's right, I came up with a good idea!
Manager, do you have a little time?
♪ Uumi-ha-I'm scared
Hune Hashizumushiokara
Pyo Pyo, I'm back now!
Welcome back, Mr. Pyokora ... and the manager
It was a very sudden outing, but ...
Where did you go?
Pyo Pyo, I'm sorry Pyo ...
With the store manager, I went a little to the sea and took a picture for a summer visit ...
Summer greeting card?
Well, this is the photo!
Dopyo, I'll use this photo for the summer greetings at the store this summer!
Umm, wonderful!
It's so cute that it's as cute as the fish in the sea ...
I agree with you!
I thought it was perfect for Pyocola-sama's image ...
It ’s good, was it fun, Piyoko?
I also wanted to go with you ...
I'm sorry, I had a sudden idea, so I didn't feel like it at that time ...
Oh, but the store manager said that we should all go to the sea this time ...!
Even if you are told not to follow me, I will follow you ...
At all ...
NEWFILE 401DF0.txt
Speaking of summer, fireworks!
I tried to say that, but in fact Piyoko doesn't really know what fireworks are like ...
Ji ~~~ ...
Eh, store manager, will you buy fireworks for Piyoko?
Wow, thank you store manager!
… Fireworks that Pyocola-sama seems to like?
Hmm ... Pyocola-sama likes things that stand out in the shadows ...
How about a fireworks display?
… Fireworks are not something that individuals can easily handle…?
Store manager, it's our duty to do something about it!
I like sparklers ...
Why?
If you're a boy, you probably like mouse fireworks and rocket fireworks, but Pyocola is a girl.
Therefore, I think that I will be pleased with something quiet and graceful like sparklers ...
I like mouse fireworks or rocket fireworks!
… Well, only one?
Then, mouse fireworks!
…the reason? Isn't it cool to explode in the end?
Oh, the store manager, the sky is getting dark!
If it rains, you won't be able to fireworks! I'll buy it soon!
Fireworks Sparkler Fireworks Mouse Fireworks
It was a terrible evening rain ...
Store manager, are you okay?
What are you talking about, not the store manager, but listening to the fireworks?
I thought fireworks were more flashy ...
However, Koyu's taste is nice ...
Is it a sparkler ...
What, this fireworks are all weak! Isn't it closed?
Major, sparklers are like this
Crackling, crackling ... Oh, the end ...
It was a terrible evening rain ...
Store manager, are you okay?
What are you talking about, not the store manager, but listening to the fireworks?
... Well, I tried to buy the fireworks, but I couldn't buy it, right?
Muka! That doesn't mean anything!
Already good! Even if you don't see fireworks, summer is summer!
It was a terrible evening rain ...
Store manager, are you okay?
What are you talking about, not the store manager, but listening to the fireworks?
… Is it safe to buy a mouse fireworks?
As expected, the store manager!
… Then, let ’s start
Ignite the place where it pops out of the ring ...
When it catches fire, throw it on the ground!
… What happened, did it disappear?
Pyo Pyo ~, the ground was wet in the evening rain!
With this, you can't do mouse fireworks ...
Disappointed, Pyo ...
NEWFILE 40242C.txt
I got it!
Ku, hard work ... Kai, what about that?
No problem, the dumplings will be completed soon
I understand that this is also ready ...
Then, do you call Pyocola-sama?
Yeah, it ’s perfect!
Let's start watching the moon!
Well, first of all, please use the astronomical telescope from Pyocola.
Nozokupyo ~
Well, it's hard to focus ...
This is ...
... I saw it!
Well, this is Crater Pyo!
I want to see, I want to see!
Wait, it's still Piyoko's turn!
NEWFILE 402680.txt
I just heard "Animal Aigoshukan"
If you don't pet animals for anything, you'll be punished.
Blurring, the earth is a scary place ...
I'm watching silently It's wrong
So, Piyoko loves animals very hard.
Pyocola, you're ready
Gokuroupyo ... Then, "Animal and friendship strategy" ... Start!
Panda Dapyo, Panda Dapyo ~!
Stroke ...
I also stroked ...
Fufufufufu, is it a panda ...
Even though it's a stuffed animal, animals are animals ...
I also want to stroke ...
Pyocola, let's take a commemorative photo!
OK Pyo!
…Yes, cheese!
Pyo ・
… Well, is n’t it?
That shouldn't be the case! It was written in the proper book!
… The store manager says it was a long time ago, right?
Pyo Pyo, Piyoko was relieved to hear that ...
So, the operation is canceled!
"Did you hear the animal barking or something?" ...?
Hahaha, it's because of my mind, the manager, because of my mind, because of my mind ...
I don't know, maybe you're tired, the store manager?
Now, store manager, please go home early and take a rest ... because it's an important body ...
NEWFILE 402A90.txt
Hey, Piyoko, it's hard!
Ku, what's wrong with that?
Well, in the park there ...
at the park?
I have an athletic meet!
... I expected and lost
No no! Instead, Di Gi Charat and others are out!
... Di Gi Charat?
Don't say that first!
What ...! ?? Currently, the team of Di Gi Charat is the top!
This cannot be overlooked
At all!
You guys do something!
Please leave it to me, Pyocola
Be sure to let Di Gi Charat bark
Fufu ... Look!
Nyonyo ~, finally the last event, the time to run 100 meters ~
Well, with the current score ... Well, if you're in 3rd place or higher, we'll win!
It ’s almost like winning
Pyo Pyo Pyo ... That's what it is!
Nyo, Piyoko, what are you coming to!
It's decided, Di Gi Charat came to jam!
It makes me feel refreshed when I say so much ...
Fufufu ... After all, we Black Gemagema are evil!
Well ... let's explain what kind of jam we did
Nice to meet you
The 100-meter dash of the final event has been changed
What has changed?
It is a 400m relay by 4 runners.
… Ordinary
Sweet, sweet, sweet, too sweet! Surprisingly, the score of this event is ...
1 billion points!
Nyonyo ~, that kind of crap!
The score so far is completely irrelevant!
Is it crap? Huh, pretty!
Because we, the Black Gemagema group, are "evil" ~
Be quiet and compete with us! And lose!
Pyo Pyo Pyo!
Go ~~~~~~~~ Rupyo ~~~~~! !! !!
Pyo Pyo, it feels good to win!
Inchikinyo, bullshit, heron!
Isn't it embarrassing to win this way!
You can say anything!
NEWFILE 4030B0.txt
What kind of pets I think pets are good for ...
Dogs ... or cats? No, more adorable ... hamsters and ferrets ...
Surprisingly, what about an iguana ...?
I would like to give away the finest toothpaste set considering the health of Pyokola's teeth.
The hair is soft and the tips of the hair are cut round so as not to damage Pyokola's teeth.
Well, what should I do ...
By the way, how much is your budget?
Uh, what you shouldn't ask ...
We, the Black Gemagema troupe, are still poor ...
To be clear, there is no budget!
If you can't buy a present, it's a waste to consult!
Ugh, I'm sorry, Pyokora-sama! On top of that, even if this Riku returns to life ...
Li, Marshal Riku, please calm down!
That's the situation, the store manager
Please, the store manager ... Please ask for money to buy gifts for yourself!
I'll ask, the store manager! Not for us, but for Piyoko!
That's right, please!
If you want to hit your shoulder, hit it!
If you want to squeeze your legs
Wow, we also ask for Geba ~! Please give me the money to buy the chief's birthday present!
To be OK
Thank you, store manager! Cut it in favor!
I've done it, I'll do something about it
So what are you going to give as a gift?
Of course, it's a cute pet!
No, it's a toothpaste set!
Let me give you an opinion too!
Pets!
Brush your teeth!
Um, um ...
Shu, Geba who can no longer collect ...
I'm sorry, the store manager, but the discussion seems to be prolonged ... Please come back later!
The store manager! Can you somehow ask for that?
Just a little bit is fine!
The store manager is terrible, I wonder if we are so disgusting!
... No, but maybe this was good
Why!
The store manager is the store manager of this store ... he is in a responsible position.
Perhaps the store manager, as the person in charge, decided that he couldn't confuse the public and private ... That's fine!
The store manager does that ...
But after all it's cold, the store manager ~!
Somehow it's funny today
Today, I feel like everyone is avoiding Piyoko.
Oh, store manager, good morning! It looks fine today as well
Yeah, I don't know what it is, but today everyone gets cold with Piyoko.
Oh my god ... I didn't decide what to give as a present ...
I can't help but stand in front of Pyokora-sama ...
I wonder if the store manager is angry about us ...
Oh, look at that!
The store manager is handing the package to Pyokora ...?
Is that ... maybe a birthday present?
Happy Birthday, Deer, Pyocola ~ ♪
Happy birthday, to you ♪
I sang it myself!
Thank you store manager, I'm thrilled!
I'm grateful for your birthday present!
Compared to that, they are inhumane! I missed it!
Pyo? … What does that mean, store manager?
Hmmmm ...
Somehow, it seems that Pyokora and the store manager are discussing.
What are you talking about ...
Oh, Piyoko is coming over here!
I'm still ready for my heart ...
Pyocola-sama is here!
you!
Hah, huh!
The story was completely told by the store manager!
Excuse me, Pyocola!
Oh, I'm not bad ...
You're saying something you don't understand?
... what?
The store manager said that he bought a present by spending no money to celebrate Piyoko's birthday.
To be clear, Piyoko was impressed
Piyoko spilled a croaker on the store manager saying that you were inhumane, without knowing your feelings.
I'm sorry
It's a wasteful word for us ... Mr. Pyocola
I'm late, but Happy Birthday, Pyocola
Congratulations to Piyoko!
Thank you, Pyo Pyo!
(Manager, thank you for noticing us ...)
(It was saved, the store manager!)
(Thank you, store manager!)

What's Piyoko?
Fufufu ... Now, Piyoko has come up with a good idea!
… So what?
Another one, I came up with an unpleasant mess for my sister!
What ...
Muka ... What's the reaction? It's a little crazy right now!
Well, it's cold today, I'm not feeling well ...
Already good! I don't ask Ku, so it's a good idea to take a nap there!
Even if you don't hurry so much, Riku and Kai will come back soon ...
... I went
Pyo ...
Well, it's a foul that it's so cold outside ...
Pyo Pyo, guts Pyo, guts!
Hmmm, Sabusabu ... Finally arrived at Gamers ...
With this, you can finally get warm in a warm place ...
It ’s different!
To the last, Piyoko's aim is an unpleasant attack on Di Gi Charat's sister!
Eh, uh, oh ...
Ah, Di Gi Charat, Di Gi Charat, if you have one, I'll reply!
I have a little talk, so I'll put it inside!
Cocoa is good for hot drinks! Repeatedly, warm cocoa!
…………
It's funny, there's no reaction ...
Kyoro Kyoro ...
Pyo, there's a tension in such a place ... Which one, I'll read it ...
"Oiss, Di Gi Charat!"
"Nyonyo, these guys are going to hot springs now."
"I'm envious, I'm envious? Then I'll be away for a few days, so please!"

Major, if you stand there, Pyokora can't look out ...
Sorry Sorry…
Wow, it's amazing! ?? The outside is pure white!
It looks like snow had piled up last night ...
Oh, it's a phone call ... Hello ...
Hmm ...
Kai, who are you?
Pyocola-sama, this is a call from Di Gi Charat and others!
Pyo?
"Let's have a snowball fight" ...
... wherever you want!
Nyo, this is still a good idea!
Pyo Pyo, where are you aiming! It doesn't hit even a little!
Riku!
Hah!
Kai!
Yes!
Ku!
Ugh!
Concentrated attack on Di Gi Charat!
Nyonyo, cowardly!
Oh, what a fierce attack!
As Di Gi Charat sees it, he becomes a snowman!

Oh, that's a shame ...

Does this mean that there is no time to rest ...
Marshal, let's get rid of the work in front of us ...
Um, then the first agenda
How to prepare three Santa Claus costumes for Christmas sale ...
What happened to the guy I prepared for Piyoko?
that is…
Pyocola-sama, how about this costume?
I hate going out because it's cold
Wow, selfish geba ...
... what did you say?
I didn't say anything!
That's why it was wasted ...
If it's this size, I might be able to wear it if I can't do it, right?
That's not the problem ...
Christmas without Santa is lonely ...
It can't be helped ... it's a hassle, but we have no choice but to make it by ourselves ...
so…

Get three Santa clothes ready today!
Uh ... how are you! ??

We will prepare 3 Santa clothes today!
All right!

Mary Chris Mars!
Wow, Merry Christmas, Geba!
Well then, everyone will be excited!
Crackling ...
Hmmm, Christmas party, it doesn't seem to be exciting ...
Not only is there no cake, but the biggest reason is that Pyokora isn't there ...
Hmm ... By this time, Pyokora is with the store manager ...
Marshal Riku, like the store manager, wanted to go out to the city of Eve with Pyokora!
Kai, you said that Pyokora would do that ...
I know ...
But to be honest, I feel the same ...
I'm home ~
Is that Pyocola-sama?
Pyocola-sama, it's a very early return ... Anything changed on the way?
What has changed? Nothing in particular ...
Rather, I bought a cake for everyone!
Ah, cake!
Ku, cut the cake and eat it together!
Alright, then ...

Wasn't Christmas someone's birthday?

Maybe it's another person ...
The correct answer is ...
Hey, it's Merry Christmas!
Oh, I was trying to say it now ...

Do you want to do it well, including those who are crying because of Di Gi Charat's lines?
Di Gi Charat is always in good spirits!

Unfortunately, after I've already eaten all the Christmas cakes!

What, the contents of the box was a high-performance bomb ... Well, it's just reading too much manga ~
What did Di Gi Charat give as a gift?
I'm looking forward to seeing what the result will be.

How did you hide in such a small box?

Jin ... The chief's warm feelings, moving geba ...
Immediately, Geba to convey this impression to other things!
By the way, Piyoko goes out to eat soba!
Piyoko, can I follow you?
OK Pyo

Let's go or not
As expected, the store manager has a good relationship
Well, what is the store manager paying for?
Really, the store manager! ??
Wow, then I'll feel free to order Piyoko!
Piyoko is tempura soba, and he asks for a special dish!
In addition, I will order ice cream and shiratama for dessert!
Oh, I'll ask for it too!
I'm Gomoku Soba and Iron Fire Bowl ... and Chawanmushi ...
I have Tanuki soba, Tsune soba, and duck nanban ...
Hmmm, an order that seems to be Riku who likes animals
It's something different ...
So let's start now!
Oh!
Pyo ...? What happened to the store manager, looking inside the wallet?
Then, the store manager, Piyoko and his friends are going!
Then, thank you for the store manager and answering machine.
The manager will buy soba for souvenirs on his way home.
Manager, have a good year! Is it still early ...
Oh, the store manager! Geba who thought he went out with the chiefs
The soba I got from the chief is still left over, but how about Geba, the store manager?
Sly sly ...
Sly sly ...
Delicious Geba ... Such a feast, Geba I can't remember for the first time in years ...
Well, store manager, I'm already full, so can I eat instead?

Oops, Pyocola-sama has somehow heard the lines somewhere!
For the time being, it seems that I'm just motivated this time too ...
Well, will you sow beans tomorrow? Setsubun
… Somehow, the glue is bad
If you have something to say, I'll ask you, so say it!
There is none
There is nothing here
I have nothing to say
…………
Don't worry, the next strategy is simple ...
Kohon, tomorrow is setsubun, so it will be full of beans in the city
The aim is to win the number!
Everyone picks up the falling beans, picks them up, and collects a lot of beans!
How is it? Is this strategy perfect?
I have no objection I agree
Same on the right ...
Hey, Piyoko
What are you doing?
How about giving special training for tomorrow?
Tokkun ... Good sound!
That's right, tomorrow is like a match that you can never lose ...
The special training here will never be a loss!
I think it's a good idea
Everyone gathers!
Geba ~~!
From now on, we will give special training for picking beans on Setsubun day tomorrow!
Everyone is sloppy! Do you think you can collect a lot of beans by doing this?
Well, I can't help it anymore!
From now on, another special training ...
Pyocola-sama, I wonder if any more special training will have the opposite effect ...
Hmmmm ... I can't help it! You guys can take a rest today!
Geba ~~!
Instead, I'll do my best tomorrow!
I'll do my best!
Everyone had a hard time! Prepare for tomorrow and take a rest today!
Geba ~~!
The town is already in the fever with beans sowed from the morning!
You guys, as I ordered yesterday, today I'll pick up the beans and pick them up! !!
Geber!
Eh, eh, geba geba!
Eh, eh, geba geba!
Good luck!
In that condition, collect stubborn beans!
Geba!
Hey, Geba with a lot of beans
With this, you don't have to worry about rice for a while.
Hmm ... it was a lot of hard work ...
It's a job to bend down ...
Ah, I'm hungry!
Then, Geba who makes dinner using these beans at once
Hmm, let's take responsibility for bringing back the beans!
Yesser, Geber!
Today's menu is simmered beans, beans curry, tofu and soy milk geba!
Thank you ... Mogumogu ... Yeah, good!
There are still a lot of calms down and eat ...
Pyocola-sama, it was a great success today!
Hmmm, it's a huge success!
Hey, today the BG team was picking beans all over the city, but what exactly is it?
I wonder if they woke up to beautification activities in the city! ??
... that's not true
Oh, I understand! I'm sure I'm going to eat the beans I picked up!
... Well, no matter how much it is, isn't it?
I think I'm eating Puchiko ...

Earlier, there was an order from Mr. Pyocola ...
order?
On Valentine's Day, we will distribute chocolates to the members, so be sure to prepare for the number of people ...
Well, when I thought that the members were strangely sloppy, was that the case?
Isn't it okay?
Ku, I don't know ...
eh?
Perhaps we will be treated the same as the members ...
In other words, we may only get chocolate-in-law ...
Oh, I believe I can get it!
I have a present for you today!
Or, inspiring Geba! You can get a present from Pyocola!
I agree with you!
Pyo lined up in a row!
Yeah, Geba!
Geba lined up!
Hoi ...
I did Geber
Hoi ...
Uh, happy Geber
Hoi ...
Uhhh, Geber
It looks like you've finished distributing the chocolates ...
Pounding ... Will we get chocolate from Pyocola-sama ...
Hey, Riku, Kai, Ku, come over here for a moment!
I'm calling!
let's go
I have something to give you
When I say ...
Receive chocolate!
Yay! Thank you, Piyoko!
I'm thrilled, Pyocola!
The chocolate is the return of Piyoko's birthday present.
Thank you, Pyocola
And also to the store manager
This is a thank you for always being indebted
Good, the store manager is the biggest ...
In return for White Day, you need something that is proportional to the size of the chocolate you gave!
eh! ?? Then maybe I shouldn't have been big ...
Pyo Pyo, just a joke!
(Pyocola-sama ... I was serious about my eyes for a moment ...)
Hmm, it ’s not easy to distribute chocolate.
Well, that's right
Do you think so too?
-So, Pyokora-sama, what do you need?
Clean up and ask for cleaning
Hey ...
Hmm, what's wrong?
No, no, nothing
Major Ku, be firm ... there will be another year ...
Hmmm, I wanted to eat chocolate ...
Yes, I had forgotten to say one thing
chocolate!
!! !! !!
There is a little left over, so it's a good idea to divide the rest among three people!
I was disappointed ...
Ku, Major Ku, surely ...
Pyocola-sama ... not much
NEWFILE 406D0C.txt
Today is a fun Hinamatsuri!
I don't have Hina dolls, so I'm a little lonely ...
Ugh, Pyocola-sama, I'm sorry ...
It made Pyokora feel sad because we weren't there ...
I'm sad too ...
Well, you don't have to mourn so much
In order to get rid of it, let me take the place of the Hina dolls!
Then, Marshal Riku will be a mess ... I will be a mess!
I don't like that kind of chick ...
Pyocola, how about hail?
Of course, I'll eat it!
Climbing, crawling ...
Hmmm! Mugugu ... but the throat ...
Is that okay, Pyocola-sama!
Water quickly, water! Hail got stuck in my throat!
Mugugu ...
Pyocola-sama, this is ...!
Very, very ...
Puha, I was saved ...
I mean, my head is dazzling ...
Hey, Piyoko ... I think I've turned my eyes ...
What did Marshal Riku, Pyokora, drink?
Mmm, I don't know! Isn't this the amazake that comes with the Hinamatsuri?
Hmmm, even though it was an emergency, it was a little sick ...
On behalf of the adults here, I'll drink them all so that minors don't accidentally say them ...
Very very ...
Very very ...
Hmmm, there's still a lot left ... Manager, can you help me with the rest?
Oops, I have to ask before that ... Is the store manager old enough to drink?
I'm asking if you're over 20!
Under 20 years old is actually over 20 years old
I can't help ... I'll drink the rest by myself
Very very ...
Pyocola-sama, Pyocola-sama, please get up!
Pyo Pyo ~ Somehow my head is throbbing ~
Piyoko, it's not the place to sleep! Riku is hard ...
Is it hard to ask? ?? ??
Pyo Pyo ~, Riku is a drunk man ~!
Hick ... I don't know if I'm a pet owner these days ...
Mumble ... I don't allow anyone who doesn't love animals to have a pet!
Store manager, do you think so too?
Yes i agree
Yeah, that's exactly right ... By the way, the manager, will you drink more?
Yes i agree
The store manager has no choice but to drink ...
By the way, do you like the store manager and animals?
Yes i agree
Well, that's right! Manager, I also love animals
No, I can say I love you! Animals ...! !!
What should I do, Pyocola-sama?
Hmm ...
What do you do, Piyoko?
Hmm ...
Well, if you leave it alone, it will be somehow managed!
Yeah, haha ??...
Well, haha ??...
(Manager, I'm sorry ...)
Then the store manager, first one ...
Alright, this is a relief! All amazake is gone
Hmm ... I don't know what it is, but suddenly I fell asleep ...
Don't worry, Pyocola! The danger has been removed
Danger? What are you talking about?
Well good Pyo Hinamatsuri continues Pyo
Piyoko, do you eat hail?
Eat it!
Climbing, crawling ...
Pyo? Why are you all paying attention to Piyoko?
No, somehow
No, nothing
I'm also eating sloppy ...
Ugh!
What, this one!
Ugh ...
Hey, what's wrong with Kuu!
good!

Pyo Pyo Pyo Pyo ...
This time has finally arrived ...
Now is the time to let your sister say Gahun!
Welcome!
Welcome to <Gamers> Gema ~!
… Well, is n’t it a customer?
What kind of paper is "Look at this"?
Well, what ...
What a new store manager, Gema!
If so, I wish I had told you quickly
Really ...
Well, you've been the manager of this Gamers for a year from today, Gema!
In the past year, making Gamers a good store ...
Wait a minute!
Geber!
Gebagebar!
Gebagebagebagebar!
Gema! ?? What is the "Black Gemagema Dan" for?
Fufufu ... This shop has just been taken by the Black Gemagema troupe!
Starting today, the name of this store is "Black Gamers" instead of "Gamers"!
If you guys understand, Hikaeoro Hikaeoro
...... Piyoko, is it okay to look like this?
Good work!
That's why, from now on, the main character of this game is this Piyoko-sama!
So, Di Gi Charat ... Gema! ??
It can't be helped ... Let's make them like it ~
Sansei Nyu ...
Well, if Di Gi Charat and Puchiko say that, wouldn't it be okay?
Gan!
Everyone, that's really good!
Gema I want the store manager to say something! !!
Let's protect this shop that is not good
Pyo Pyo, I've come to a conclusion
Then, all the rest is left to this Piyoko-sama!
Black Gemagema Dan, Banzai!
Piyoko-Analog III, the leader of the Black Gemagema, Banzai!
Then, new store manager, I'll ask for the rest
If you have any problems, feel free to come and talk to us.
Hey, where are you going?
Where are you going to help other Gamers?
Gamers are not one
It was just a busy place, so I was saved.
Goodbye ~
Goodbye
Excuse me
Do, do, they've gone! ??
Pyo, Pyocola ...
Somehow, it seems that I was done in reverse ...
Mmm ...
When this happens, I'll show you the greatness of the Black Gemagema group! !!
You'll get better grades than your sister!
For the time being, I would like the store manager to cooperate as well! Nice to meet you!
Di Gi Charat doesn't care ~
But it can't be helped if the store manager orders it ~
There is no choice
Well, if Di Gi Charat and Puchiko were like that, wouldn't it be okay?
Pyo!
Older sisters, is that okay? It's a little too sloppy!
Take good care of yourself!
Well, on your way home! It's a nuisance to other customers, so let's go out!
If you don't listen to what you say, a beam may come out of your eyes ♪
Puchiko is also on standby!
Pyo, Pyocola is dangerous! Here for the time being! !!
Besides, it seems that life is dangerous if you do not run away!
Withdrawal ~! !!
Ge, Geba!
Oh, sister! Today, I'll leave it at this level for today ...!
But, my sister, I'll just say this!
What?
In the previous question, if you select "I don't like it", it will be the Black Gamers edition!
So, if you want to do Black Gamers, start over from the beginning!
Piyoko ...
Commentary, it's Gokuro-san ...
... Well, there are no more jammers, so let's go back to the usual development.
OK Gema ...!
Um ... Gema ...
Then, the store manager, Gema who chooses one "assistant" from three people
The person who became an "assistant" has been a gema who has helped the store manager in particular for the past year.
So, think carefully and choose
Store manager, do your best with Piyo!
I can't give up on my sister!
NEWFILE 40D98C.txt
Welcome!
Welcome to <Gamers> Gema ~!
… Well, is n’t it a customer?
What kind of paper is "Look at this"?
Well, what ...
What a new store manager, Gema!
If so, I wish I had told you quickly
Really ...
Well, you've been the manager of this Gamers for a year from today, Gema!
It's my job to make Gamers a good store in the last year
Gema I want you to do your best to make the store happy and good for customers
Next, Gema who will help the shop with three people
Di Gi Charat!
Hmmm, the most important thing is "beam from the eyes"!
Well then, I'll give it a try, so I'll take a look!
Beam from the eyes!
Gema!
……………………
Eh. Roughly like this!
Already ... what are you doing ...
As always, don't worry
I'm La Bi Ann Rose ...
Feel free to call it "Usada"!
It ’s not “Usada” but “La Bi Ann Rose”!
Well, it's a calming gema
La Bi Ann Rose is really a gema named "Usada Hikaru"
However, Usada gets angry if he doesn't call him "La Bi Ann Rose".
Therefore, it is better not to call a rabbit in front of him.
Then, the last third gema
…………
Puchiko Nyu
Well, um, Puchiko is small, so I don't really like talking.
But when I say it, I say it! Gema to be careful!
Don't treat me as a child ...
Then, the manager, Gema who chooses one "assistant" from these three people
The person who became an "assistant" has been a gema who has helped the store manager in particular for the past year.
So, think carefully and choose
Gema to choose "assistant"!
Di Gi Charat Puchiko
Nyonyo ~, as expected, the new store manager Shannyo!
Let's do our best together with Di Gi Charat!
There is nothing scary if there is this Di Gi Charat, and Gamers is the best in the world in no time!
Well, of course, I'll choose me
Let's do our best to make it a nice shop.
Nice to meet you, new store manager
Good luck

My name is Piyoko-Analog III Pyo
The famous leader of the Black Gemagema troupe!
Piyoko's only purpose is to catch Di Gi Charat!
However, this is hard to catch ...
Hesitation!
What's wrong?
... I'm sure someone made a rumor about Di Gi Charat ~
Well, I'd say it myself, but Di Gi Charat can't help being a big actress of the future, rumor.
Well, I'm aiming for a popular idol ...
Yes, let's go next
Three people from "PKO", that is ...
"Riku-Heisenberg",
"Kai-Schweitzer",
"Ku-Ehrhardt"
These three are the executives of the Black Gemagema group.
Riku is a marshal of the Black Gemagema troupe and an animal doctor, Pyo.
Riku is an executive leader and loves animals.
Kai is a lieutenant general of the Black Gemagema troupe and a dentist.
Kai is said to be a little inconspicuous. It seems that he also cares ...
Ku is a major of the Black Gemagema group and is a physician.
Ku is familiar with Piyoko, and Piyoko's best friend, Pyo.
Mysterious Gema is ... It can only be called Mysterious Gema
A mysterious guy who doesn't even know what it really is
Black Gemagema members. Anyway, there are many
I'm a member of Black Gemagema!
For our leader, Piyoko-Analog III,
Whether it's today or tomorrow, I'll work hard!
By the way, it's finally time for Piyoko and his friends to come in.
For starters, take a look at Di Gi Charat's shop
Make Black Gamers!
The story of Piyoko and his friends is then Pyo!
You guys introduce yourself!
First of all, Piyoko Karapyo
I'm Piyoko-Analog III, the leader of the Black Gemagema troupe!
Now that Piyoko has arrived, I won't let her like her anymore!
I'm Riku Heisenberg, the Marshal of the Black Gemagema troupe!
All for Pyocola!
I am Lieutenant General Kai Schweizer. A person who protects Pyocola!
I have to protect Pyocola from the awesome Di Gi Charat gang ...
I'm Ku Ehrhardt. Piyoko has been with me since I was little, and I'm like my sister.
I forgot to say that I'm Major Black Gemagema!
Pyo Pyo Pyo ... Welcome to Black Gamers.
I'm honored to have exchanged business cards with Pyocola.
Starting today, you have joined us as a candidate for Black Gamers executives!
Well, now you can always be the manager of Black Gamers.

Oh, Di Gi Charat, it's pretty early today. what's wrong with you?
It's not "something happened"!
A new store manager is coming to this store soon!
I see, that's why I cleaned the inside of the store cleanly.
Nyonyo, it's already gone!
Nyonyo, it's okay when a new store manager comes in with this ~
For the time being, only the first impression is perfect!
What is "only the first impression"?
Ahahahaha ...
I don't think I can laugh at people so much ...
Somehow, the new store manager feels sorry for Gema
It's okay, I can only do it
Everyone's self-introduction gema!
My name is Gema!
Di Gi Charat!
Hmmm, the most important thing is "beam from the eyes"!

Store manager, every day, you're gonna get rid of it!
Gema, the time for interim settlement once every three months has arrived!
Then, Gema who will announce the result immediately!
As expected, the store manager has a wonderful record!
If you go in this condition, there will be no problem!
So, store manager, thank you for your continued support!

Manager, Gema who works harder!
The store manager, is it Gema talking to Di Gi Charat?
If Di Gi Charat isn't working, customers won't come!
Also, is the number of slots increasing properly?
If the number of slots increases, you will be able to sell a lot of goods at once!
That's why I want you to do your best in the future by making use of the advice of the manager Gema!
